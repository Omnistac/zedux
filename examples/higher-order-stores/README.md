# Zedux Higher-Order Stores Example

This example demonstrates the power of composable stores by using Higher-Order Stores to extend a store's functionality. This is much more elegant than middleware.

## To view

This example uses the excellent [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). To run the example, simply clone this repo, open it in a terminal, and run the following commands:

```bash
cd examples
npm install
npm start -- higher-order-stores
```

Then open `localhost:1234` in a browser. Enjoy!

Note that parcel supports Hot Module Replacement, so feel free to play around with that too!
