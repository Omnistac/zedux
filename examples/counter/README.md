# Zedux Counter Example

Just a simple multi-store counter example. This example can be run stand-alone, but it's mostly just some common code used by the other examples.

## To view

This example uses the excellent [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). To run the example, simply clone this repo, open it in a terminal, and run the following commands:

```bash
cd examples
npm install
npm start -- counter
```

Then open `localhost:1234` in a browser. Enjoy!

Note that parcel supports Hot Module Replacement, so feel free to play around with that too!
