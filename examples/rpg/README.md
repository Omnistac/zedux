# Zedux RPG Example

What better way to push a library to its limits than by writing a game? Alright, this isn't much of a game, but it does demonstrate the depth of Zedux.

## To view

This example uses the excellent [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org). To run the example, simply clone this repo, open it in a terminal, and run the following commands:

```bash
cd examples
npm install
npm start -- rpg
```

Then open `localhost:1234` in a browser. Enjoy!

Note that parcel supports Hot Module Replacement, so feel free to play around with that too!
