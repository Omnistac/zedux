Atom templates are like classes. Whenever an atom template is used, Zedux creates an "instance" of that atom and caches it. So what does an atom instance look like?

:::tip you will learn:

- How atom params work
- How to get an atom instance itself
- Some properties and methods of atom instances.

## Atom Params

When an atom state factory takes params, Zedux creates a different atom instance for every "unique" set of params you pass. So how does Zedux determine "uniqueness"?

Zedux doesn't compare object references. Internally, Zedux turns all params into a single string. This "hashing" is deterministic. If you know React Query, this should all sound familiar 'cause that's where we got the idea. Check out [React Query's docs on this](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-keys#query-keys-are-hashed-deterministically).

Let's look at some examples. Given this atom template:

```ts
const myParamsAtom = atom('myParams', (a: any, b: any) => {
  ...
})
```

The following params are considered the same - Zedux will translate them to the exact same atom instance:

```ts
useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [{ one, two }, three])
useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [{ two, one }, three])
```

But the following params are all different (params order and array order matter):

```ts
useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [{ one, two }, three])
useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [three, { one, two }])

useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [[one, two], three])
useAtomState(myParamsAtom, [[two, one], three])
```

## `useAtomInstance()`

We saw this in the [quick start](quick-start), but quick recap:

`useAtomInstance()` is a lower-level hook than `useAtomState()` that returns the entire atom instance. Importantly, unlike `useAtomState()`, it doesn't cause a rerender when the atom instance's state changes.

```tsx live ecosystemId=atom-instances/useAtomInstance resultVar=App
const counterAtom = atom('counter', 0)

function Static() {
  // useAtomInstance does _not_ trigger rerenders
  const greetingInstance = useAtomInstance(counterAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => greetingInstance.setState(state => state + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
      <span> non-updating state: {greetingInstance.getState()}</span>
    </div>
  )
}

function Dynamic() {
  // useAtomState triggers rerenders on state update
  const [counter, setState] = useAtomState(counterAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setState(state => state + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <span> state: {counter}</span>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Static />
      <Dynamic />
    </>
  )
}
```

Click the buttons a few times and you'll see the `Dynamic` component update while the `Static` component stays ... static, even though both buttons are doing exactly the same thing.

This example is contrived - you shouldn't ever _read_ an atom's state during render like this (use `useAtomValue` for that). But one of the primary uses of `useAtomInstance` is to _set_ an atom's state without subscribing to state updates.

```ts
// subscribes:
const [, setState] = useAtomState(myAtom)
...
setState(newState)

// doesn't subscribe:
const instance = useAtomInstance(myAtom)
...
instance.setState(newState)
```

Another primary use case is to get a reference to the atom instance that can be read synchronously anywhere. This can be necessary sometimes to prevent reading stale closed-over values in React callbacks. See [this discussion](https://github.com/Omnistac/zedux/discussions/189).

:::tip

Use `useAtomInstance` instead of `useAtomValue` to:

- prevent rerenders
- set state without reading
- read the atom's current state in callbacks without waiting for React to rerender

Use `useAtomValue` (or `useAtomState`) instead to:

- trigger rerenders
- update displayed UI values

:::

:::tip
You'll find that Zedux gives you a _lot_ of control over React rerenders. This is one of the primary reasons we created it.

Alright, we did a few things with the atom instance that we haven't seen before. Let's look at those now.

## Atom Instances

Every [atom instance](../api/classes/AtomInstance) is just an object with several useful properties and methods, including:

### `params`

An array of the params of this atom instance, in the order passed

```ts
const blogPostCommentAtom = atom(
  'blogPostComment',
  (blogPostId: string, commentId: string) => {
    ...
  }
)

// in a React component:
const instance = useAtomInstance(blogPostCommentAtom, [1, 2])
const [blogPostId, commentId] = instance.params // [1, 2]
```

### `status`

A string. Every atom instance goes through a lifecycle:

![Initializing -> Active \<-> Stale -> Destroyed](/img/diagrams/status-machine.png)

`instance.status` should typically be `'Active'` on instances you use. We'll talk more about these in [the destruction walkthrough](destruction).

### `store`

A reference to the atom instance's store. Every atom instance has one. If the atom's state factory returns a store, this will be a reference to that store.

```tsx
const storeAtom = atom('store', () => {
  const store = injectStore('initial state')

  return store
})

function MyComponent() {
  const instance = useAtomInstance(storeAtom)
  instance.store // <- this is the exact same store that we returned
}
```

Quick recap of zero-config store basics:

```ts
store.getState() // returns the current state of the store
store.setState('new state') // overwrites the store's state

// recursively merge state into existing state:
store.setStateDeep({ deeply: { merge: 'this state' } })

// function overloads - set new state based on current state
store.setState(state => state + 1)
store.setStateDeep(state => ({ someKey: state.someKey + 1 }))
```

### `template`

A reference to the atom template that this atom instance is an instance of.

```ts
const exampleAtom = atom('example', () => 'my state')
...
const instance = useAtomInstance(exampleAtom)
instance.template === exampleAtom // true
```

### `getState()`

An alias for [`instance.store.getState()`](../api/classes/Store#getstate). Returns the current state of the atom instance's store:

```ts
const instance = getInstance(myAtom)
instance.getState() === instance.store.getState()
```

### `setState()`

The most common way to set the state of an atom instance's store. An alias for [`instance.store.setState()`](../api/classes/Store#setstate). Function overload supported.

```ts
const instance = getInstance(myAtom)
instance.setState(newState)
instance.setState(currentState => newState)
```

:::tip
The `setState` function returned by [`useAtomState()`](../api/hooks/useAtomState) and [`injectAtomState()`](../api/injectors/injectAtomState) is a wrapper around this function.
:::

### `invalidate()`

Call this to force the atom instance to reevaluate. Typically you should avoid impure or mutation-oriented patterns that require you to manually invalidate atom instances. But there are some useful invalidation patterns that we'll look at in [the resets walkthrough](resets).

```tsx live ecosystemId=atom-instances/invalidate resultVar=RandomNum
const randomNumAtom = atom('randomNum', () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))

function RandomNum() {
  const instance = useAtomInstance(randomNumAtom)
  const value = useAtomValue(randomNumAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <div>Random Number: {value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => instance.invalidate()}>Re-roll</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Recap

- Atom params are hashed deterministically.
- `useAtomInstance()` returns an atom instance without subscribing to state updates.
- Atom instances have a lot of features. We'll cover more in the rest of this walkthrough.

## Next Steps

Atom instances have more features such as exporting functions and kicking off React suspense. To unlock these powers, you need [Atom APIs](atom-apis).
