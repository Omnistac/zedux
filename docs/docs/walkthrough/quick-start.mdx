Zedux is a powerful state management tool for React.

Its React architecture is atomic - similar to [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) and [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai).

State is held in stores - similar to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @zedux/react
```

## Meet the Atoms

Atoms are your building blocks. Create them with the `atom()` factory:

```ts
import { atom } from '@zedux/react'

const greetingAtom = atom('greeting', 'Hello, world!')
```

Here we created an atom with the key `greeting` and initial value `'Hello, world!'`.

Atoms themselves don't hold any state. Atoms are state templates. To make the magic happen, we need to actually use the atom. We can do this with hooks:

```tsx
import { useAtomState } from '@zedux/react'

function Greet() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useAtomState(greetingAtom)
  ...
}
```

The first time we use the atom, Zedux creates a new "atom instance" (similar to a class instance). Every atom instance has a store that holds its state.

Our `greetingAtom` instance contains a single store whose state is the string `'Hello, world!'`. Zedux created this store automatically. We'll learn how to manually create stores later.

### Setting State

`useAtomState()` is very similar to React's `useState()` hook; it returns a `[state, setState]` tuple.

In our example, we can use `setGreeting` to update the state of the atom instance's store. Let's expand the example in a live playground (feel free to poke around!):

```tsx live ecosystemId=quick-start/setting-state resultVar=Greeting
const greetingAtom = atom('greeting', 'Hello, world!')

function GreetingPreview() {
  const [greeting] = useAtomState(greetingAtom)

  return <div>The greeting: {greeting}</div>
}

function EditGreeting() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useAtomState(greetingAtom)

  return (
    <input
      onChange={({ target }) => setGreeting(target.value)}
      value={greeting}
    />
  )
}

const Greeting = () => (
  <>
    <GreetingPreview />
    <EditGreeting />
  </>
)
```

These live playgrounds have every React and Zedux export in scope. Click `Log > Atom State` in any Live Sandbox and open your browser console to inspect the current state of all your atoms.
:::

Super In-Depth Technical Breakdown Here:

- We create an atom with the key `greeting`.
- The `<Greeting>` component renders 2 children: `<GreetingPreview>` and `<EditGreeting>`.
- `<GreetingPreview>` renders first and calls `useAtomState` to get the state of the `greeting` atom instance.
- Zedux sees that the `greeting` atom has never been used before, so it creates an atom instance with a store whose initial state is `'Hello, world!'`. `useAtomState` returns that state to `<GreetingPreview>`.
- `<EditGreeting>` renders next and also calls `useAtomState`.
- Zedux sees that the `greeting` atom has a cached atom instance, so this time `useAtomState` returns the current state of the cached atom instance's store.

Notice that the atom instance's state is shared between both components. This state reuse is one of the main features of atoms.

Try clicking `Log > Graph` in the Live Sandbox header above. Expand the logged object in your browser console and you'll see that Zedux has created a dependency graph. The `greeting` atom instance has two dependents, one for each React component that called `useAtomState`. Because of this, whenever the atom instance's state updates, both these React components will rerender. That's the magic of atoms!

### State Factories

The second parameter to `atom` can be a factory function. This factory's job is to create and return the atom's state:

```ts
const helloAtom = atom('hello', () => 'world')
```

State factories have many use cases (and this simple example is not one of them). We'll look at a few right now.

### Dependency Injection

Atoms can use other atoms. To use another atom, we "inject" it in the state factory:

```ts
import { atom, injectAtomState } from '@zedux/react'

const textAtom = atom('text', 'World')

const loudGreetingAtom = atom('loudGreeting', () => {
  const [text] = injectAtomState(textAtom)

  return `HELLO, ${text.toUpperCase()}`
})
```

Here we used an "injector" - `injectAtomState` - to create a dependency on `textAtom`.

`injectAtomState()` is just like `useAtomState()`, but is used in atoms instead of components. This is a common theme with injectors:

### Injectors Are Like Hooks

Atom state factories look very similar to React function components. Zedux exports injectors like `injectEffect` and `injectMemo` that behave like React's `useEffect` and `useMemo`.

There are many advantages to this approach:

- Atoms are reactive by default. Just like React components, they rerender (we say "reevaluate") when their state updates.

- Atoms have a small learning curve if you know hooks.

- Injectors are composable, just like hooks. Abstracting common logic is easy 'cause it's just JavaScript.

```tsx
import { atom, injectMemo } from '@zedux/react'

const initialPriceAtom = atom('initialPrice', () => {
  // Let's say stockPriceAtom's state changes frequently:
  const [stockPrice] = injectAtomState(stockPriceAtom)
  const initialPrice = injectMemo(() => stockPrice, [])

  return initialPrice
})
```

If you know React's `useMemo` hook, you should already be able to understand this example. But to break it down:

- `initialPriceAtom` (or rather the "atom instance" Zedux creates) is reevaluated every time the injected `stockPriceAtom` instance's state changes.
- Since `injectMemo()` doesn't have any dependencies, it never recalculate its value. So:
- The `initialPrice` we return never changes, meaning the `initialPriceAtom`'s state never changes. So:
- Components that use `initialPriceAtom` won't rerender and other atoms that use it won't reevaluate.

:::info important
Injectors have the same caveats as hooks too! E.g. don't put injectors in if statements or use them outside atom state factories.
:::

:::tip
In general, the simple rule is: Replace the word "use" with "inject" inside atoms. Custom injectors you make should also start with "inject".
:::

### Atom Instances

Let's review what we have so far.

When we create an atom, Zedux waits until the atom is used (e.g. by a component or another atom) to create an atom instance + store. When we pass a state factory to `atom()`, that function won't be called until Zedux instantiates the atom. When the atom is used for the first time, Zedux creates an atom instance and calls the state factory to produce the initial value of the instance's store.

You can think of atoms like classes, but you never instantiate the class yourself - Zedux does it for you.

Atoms can inject other atoms. When injected dependencies update, Zedux calls the state factory again to produce a new value (similar to a rerender in React). If a different value is returned, Zedux will update this atom instance's dependents, and so on down the graph tree.

```tsx
function Greeting() {
  const [greeting] = useAtomState(greetingAtom)
  ...
}

const SomeGreetings = () => (
  <>
    <Greeting />
    <Greeting />
  </>
)
```

Here, the first `<Greeting />` renders and Zedux creates an instance of `greetingAtom`. The next `<Greeting />` then renders and reuses that same atom instance.

Usually this just works and you don't have to worry about it. But sometimes you'll need to create multiple instances of an atom. To make Zedux create more instances, we use params.

### Params

We can pass parameters to atoms:

```ts
// This atom accepts a single `id` param
const userDataAtom = atom('userData', (id: string) => {
  // a hypothetical injector for simplicity (sends the request and tracks state).
  // we'll look at handling promises later:
  return injectFetch(`/users/${id}`)
})

function UserOverview() {
  const { data } = useAtomState(userDataAtom, ['joe'])
  ...
}
```

Here the `userData` atom takes one parameter, `id`. When the `UserOverview` component uses the `userData` atom, Zedux creates an instance of `userData` with `'joe'` as the id.

If we use the `userData` atom multiple times with different `id`s, Zedux will create different atom instances:

```tsx
function UserOverview() {
  const [joeData] = useAtomState(userDataAtom, ['joe'])
  const [bobData] = useAtomState(userDataAtom, ['bob'])
  ...
}
```

This example creates two instances of the `userData` atom - one that fetches the `joe` user and one that fetches `bob`. Each of these instances controls its own, distinct state.

:::info important
Atom parameters must be serializable. Zedux converts them to a single, predictable string that uniquely identifies each atom instance. You shouldn't need params much, but when you do need them, make them as small as possible.
:::

:::tip
Atoms that don't take params are called singletons. Atoms that take params are called families (based on Recoil's terminology).

If you know Recoil and React Query, think of Zedux atoms as a cross between Recoil's atom, atomFamily, selector, and selectorFamily, and React Query's queries and mutations.
:::

## Recap

- Atoms are like classes that Zedux instantiates for you.

- Atom instances can be used in React components with hooks like `useAtomState`.

- Atom instances can be injected into other atom instances using "injectors" like `injectAtomState`.

- Injectors are like hooks. State factories are like React components that return state instead of UI.

- Atom instances are created by passing different params and reused by passing the same params.

Let's finish off the quick start with a good old todos playground:

```tsx live resultVar=Todos ecosystemId=quick-start/todos
const todosAtom = atom('todos', () => [
  { text: 'Go', isDone: true },
  { text: 'Fight', isDone: true },
  { text: 'Win', isDone: false },
])

const filteredTodosAtom = atom('filteredTodos', (isDone: boolean) => {
  const [todos] = injectAtomState(todosAtom)
  const filteredTodos = todos.filter(todo => todo.isDone === isDone)

  return filteredTodos.map(({ text }) => text)
})

// These 2 components pass different params to the filteredTodos atom:
function FinishedTodos() {
  const [todos] = useAtomState(filteredTodosAtom, [true])

  return <div>Finished Todos: {todos.join`, `}</div>
}

function UnfinishedTodos() {
  const [todos] = useAtomState(filteredTodosAtom, [false])

  return <div>Unfinished Todos: {todos.join`, `}</div>
}

const Todos = () => (
  <>
    <FinishedTodos />
    <UnfinishedTodos />
  </>
)
```

## Next Steps

At this point you should know more than enough to start using Zedux. But there is a lot more to discover!

The rest of this walkthrough will cover every major feature. You can also play with the [examples](/not-done), skip ahead to the [API Docs](../api/classes/Atom), or take a step back and read [introduction stuff](../about/introduction).

Next, we'll learn how to give atoms control of [their own state](atom-state).
