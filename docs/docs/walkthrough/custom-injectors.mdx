If you use React, you've probably written custom hooks. These are functions whose names start with `use` and that compose other hooks.

Zedux injectors have the same composability. Custom injectors are just functions whose names start with `inject` and that compose other injectors.

How to create, compose, and use custom injectors
:::

## Rules

Custom injectors can do almost anything you want. They're Just JavaScript. Just remember that the function name should start with the word "inject" - e.g. `injectUserStream` or `injectFetchUser`.

An injector will also always call other injectors - if it doesn't, it isn't an injector!

## An Example

The [quick start](quick-start) referenced a theoretical custom `injectFetch` injector. Let's create it for real:

```ts
const injectFetch = (url: string) => {
  const store = injectStore({ status: 'loading' })

  injectEffect(async () => {
    try {
      const result = await fetch(url)
      const data = await result.json()

      store.setState({ data, status: 'success' })
    } catch (err) {
      store.setState({ error: err, status: 'error' })
    }
  }, [url])

  return api(store).setPromise(promise)
}
```

Now we can use this injector to fetch data in any other atom:

```ts
const usersAtom = atom('users', () => {
  const { store } = injectFetch('/api/users')

  return store
})

const friendsAtom = atom('friends', () => {
  return injectFetch('/api/friends')
})
```

Notice that `usersAtom` returns only the store, while `friendsAtom` returns the entire Atom API. Let's take a closer look at this flexibility afforded by Atom APIs:

## Using Atom APIs

Atom instances have 3 "meta data types" that you'll find yourself working with a lot in your state factories and custom injectors:

- State (usually inside stores)
- Exports
- Promises

The [Atom API](atom-apis) is a standard way to pass these 3 things around.

```ts
// This Atom API is essentially a container for the 3 meta data types:
const myApi = api(myStore).setExports(myExports).setPromise(myPromise)

// we can access all 3 easily:
const { exports, promise, store } = myApi
```

Atom APIs are designed to be passed around between injectors and ultimately composed together into a single Atom API that gets returned from your state factory. You can of course pass stuff around however you want, but the Atom API is a useful standard for this.

:::tip
[`injectPromise()`](../api/injectors/injectPromise) itself uses this pattern - returning an Atom API with a store and promise attached.
:::

## `injectSelf()`

Zedux's built-in injectors (`injectMemo`, `injectAtomInstance`, etc) have access to the currently-evaluating atom instance before it's fully initialized. When accessed during initial evaluation, the atom instance doesn't have its `exports`, `promise`, or `store` properties set yet - that's the purpose of the initial evaluation!

With that in mind, Zedux exports an injector that allows you to access the not-yet-initialized instance - [`injectSelf()`](../api/injectors/injectSelf):

```ts
import { atom, injectSelf } from '@zedux/react'

const exampleAtom = atom('example', () => {
  const partialInstance = injectSelf()

  partialInstance.store.setState() // ERROR! Store not set yet
  partialInstance.promise.then(...) // ERROR! Promise not set yet
  partialInstance.exports.myExportedFn() // ERROR! Exports not set yet

  ...
})
```

On subsequent evaluations, those properties will exist. It is safe to use them after a check that they exist:

```ts
const exampleAtom = atom('example', () => {
  const partialInstance = injectSelf()

  if (partialInstance.store) {
    partialInstance.store.getState()
  }

  ...
})
```

TypeScript users will see that `injectSelf()` returns a `PartialAtomInstance | AnyAtomInstance` type. Type casts to improve this are safe enough after a type guard like in the above example. To get full type support, type-cast the value using the `AtomInstanceType` TS helper:

```ts
if ((partialInstance as AtomInstanceType<typeof exampleAtom>).store) {
  ;(partialInstance as AtomInstanceType<typeof exampleAtom>).store.setState()
}
```

All other AtomInstance properties and methods are free game. For example, `injectSelf()` is often used to get the fully-qualified id of the current atom instance:

```ts
const exampleAtom = atom('example', (param1: string, param2: number) => {
  const { id } = injectSelf()

  return id
})

function ExampleComponent() {
  const value = useAtomValue(exampleAtom, ['a', 1])
  value // 'example-["a",1]'
  ...
}
```

:::tip
Watch out for reevaluation loops when calling [`instance.invalidate()`](../api/classes/AtomInstance#invalidate) - make sure you gate it behind `if` statements or callback functions.
:::

## Recap

- Custom injectors can encapsulate any logic you want
- Atom APIs are a convenient standard for passing stores, exports, and promises around
- Use [`injectSelf()`](../api/injectors/injectSelf) to get a reference to the currently-evaluating atom instance.

## Next Steps

Custom injectors have many uses. Let's look at using them to [reset atoms](resets).
