If you use React, you've probably written custom hooks. These are functions whose names start with `use` and that compose other hooks.

Zedux injectors have the same composability. Custom injectors are just functions whose names start with `inject` and that compose other injectors.

How to create, compose, and use custom injectors

## Rules

Custom injectors can do almost anything you want. They're Just JavaScript. Just remember that the function name should start with the word "inject" - e.g. `injectUserStream` or `injectFetchUser`.

An injector will also always call other injectors - if it doesn't, it isn't an injector!

## An Example

The [quick start](quick-start) referenced a theoretical custom `injectFetch` injector. Let's create it for real:

```ts
const injectFetch = (url: string) => {
  const store = injectStore({ status: 'loading' })

  injectEffect(async () => {
    try {
      const result = await fetch(url)
      const data = await result.json()

      store.setState({ data, status: 'success' })
    } catch (err) {
      store.setState({ error: err, status: 'error' })
    }
  }, [url])

  return api(store).setPromise(promise)
}
```

Now we can use this injector to fetch data in any other atom:

```ts
const usersAtom = atom('users', () => {
  const { store } = injectFetch('/api/users')

  return store
})

const friendsAtom = atom('friends', () => {
  return injectFetch('/api/friends')
})
```

Notice that `usersAtom` returns only the store, while `friendsAtom` returns the entire Atom API. Let's take a closer look at this flexibility afforded by Atom APIs:

## Using Atom APIs

Atom instances have 3 "meta data types" that you'll find yourself working with a lot in your state factories and custom injectors:

- State (usually inside stores)
- Exports
- Promises

The [Atom API](atom-apis) is a standard way to pass these 3 things around.

```ts
// This Atom API is essentially a container for the 3 meta data types:
const myApi = api(myStore).setExports(myExports).setPromise(myPromise)

// we can access all 3 easily:
const { exports, promise, store } = myApi
```

Atom APIs are designed to be passed around between injectors and ultimately composed together into a single Atom API that gets returned from your state factory. You can of course pass stuff around however you want, but the Atom API is a useful standard for this.

:::tip
[`injectPromise()`](../api/injectors/injectPromise) itself uses this pattern - returning an Atom API with a store and promise attached.
:::

## Native Injectors

Zedux actually exposes the [`createInjector()`](../api/factories/createInjector) factory it uses to create the built-in injectors like `injectEffect()` and `injectMemo()`. With this factory, you can create custom injectors with every capability that Zedux's own injectors have.

The one capability that `createInjector()` gives you that nothing else does is access to the partially-created atom instance currently being created. This can be useful for custom injectors since they otherwise don't know which atom they're being used in.

This "partial instance" is hidden from everything else because on initial evaluation, the atom instance doesn't have many things you'd expect to exist on an instance - namely the 3 "meta data types" (store, exports, promise). These haven't been created yet. That's the purpose of the initial evaluation!

This is a low-level feature. So low that it's out of the scope of this walkthrough. But if you're interested, check it out in [the API docs](../api/factories/createInjector).

## Recap

- Custom injectors can encapsulate any logic you want
- Atom APIs are a convenient standard for passing stores, exports, and promises around
- Low-level native injectors can be created with `createInjector()`.

## Next Steps

Custom injectors have many uses. Let's look at using them to [reset atoms](resets).
