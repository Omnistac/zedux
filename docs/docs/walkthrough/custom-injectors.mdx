If you use React, you've probably written custom hooks. These are functions whose names start with `use` and that compose other hooks.

In Zedux, we have the same thing but for injectors. Custom injectors are just functions whose names start with `inject` and that compose other injectors.

How to create, compose, and use custom injectors

## Rules

Custom injectors can do almost anything you want. They're Just JavaScript. Remember these rules:

- Injectors should start with the word "inject" - e.g. `injectUserStream` or `injectFetchUser`.
- Injectors contain calls to other injectors. Those can be built-in injectors or other custom ones. If the function doesn't call other injectors, it isn't an injector.
- Injectors are composable. Your injector should be able to be used by other injectors. You'll probably never need to worry about this; most logic you might put in an injector should be fine.

## An Example

In the [quick start](quick-start), we referenced a theoretical custom `injectFetch` injector. Let's create it for real:

```ts
const injectFetch = (url: string) => {
  const store = injectStore({ status: 'loading' })

  injectEffect(async () => {
    try {
      const result = await fetch(url)
      const data = await result.json()

      store.setState({ data, status: 'success' })
    } catch (err) {
      store.setState({ error: err, status: 'error' })
    }
  }, [url])

  return api(store).setPromise(promise)
}
```

Now we can use this injector to fetch data in any other atom:

```ts
const usersAtom = atom('users', () => {
  const { store } = injectFetch('/api/users')

  return store
})

const friendsAtom = atom('friends', () => {
  return injectFetch('/api/friends')
})
```

Notice that in `usersAtom` we returned only the store, while in `friendsAtom` we returned the entire Atom API from `injectFetch`. Let's take a closer look at this flexibility afforded by Atom APIs:

## Using Atom APIs

Atom instances have 3 "meta data types" that you'll find yourself working with a lot in your state factories and custom injectors:

- State (usually inside stores)
- Exports
- Promises

The [Atom API](atom-apis) is a standard way to pass these 3 things around.

```ts
// This Atom API is essentially a container for the 3 meta data types:
const myApi = api(myStore).setExports(myExports).setPromise(myPromise)

// we can access all 3 easily:
const { exports, promise, store } = myApi
```

Atom APIs are designed to be passed around between injectors and ultimately composed together into a single Atom API that gets returned from your state factory. You can of course pass stuff around however you want, but the Atom API is a useful standard for this.

:::tip
[`injectPromise()`](../api/injectors/injectPromise) itself uses this pattern - returning an Atom API with a store and promise attached.
:::

## Recap

- Custom injectors can encapsulate any logic you want
- Atom APIs are a convenient standard for passing stores, exports, and promises around

## Next Steps

Custom injectors have many uses. Let's look at using them to [reset atoms](resets).
