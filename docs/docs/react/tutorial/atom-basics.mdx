## Stores

Every instance of every atom creates a store. Stores manage lots of the heavy work of atoms - storing and updating state, informing subscribers of state updates, telling consumer atoms to reevaluate, telling React components to rerender.

Stores have lots of cool features, including the ability to compose multiple stores together. For now, just remember that every atom instance has an underlying store. Some hooks and injectors subscribe to the store, and others do not.

## Instances

Atoms expose a `.useInstance()` hook and `.injectInstance()` injector. These can be used to get a reference to an instance of the atom. This does not subscribe to the atom's store. This hook/injector can be used to avoid needing to re-specify params on parameterized atoms:

```tsx
function App() {
  // Before:
  const params = [{ some: ['complex', 'params'] }, 'here']
  const value = myAtom.useValue(...params)
  const dispatch = myAtom.useDispatch(...params)

  // After:
  const instance = myAtom.useInstance({ some: ['complex', 'params'] }, 'here')
  const value = instance.useValue() // no need to pass params here
  const dispatch = instance.useDispatch() // nor here
  ...
}
```

Note that while `.useInstance()` does not subscribe to the instance's store, `instance.useValue()` does.

`.useInstance()` can also be used in conjunction with `.useConsumer()` to provide an instance over React context, so deeply nested children don't need to know the params of a specific atom instance they want to reuse:

```tsx
function Parent() {
  const instance = myAtom.useInstance('some', 'params')

  return (
    <instance.Provider>
      <Child />
    </instance.Provider>
  )
}

function Child() {
  const instance = myAtom.useConsumer() // no need to pass params here
  const value = instance.useValue() // subscribe to the instance's store
}
```
