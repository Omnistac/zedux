title: Side Effects

Zedux stores do not have middleware. Read more on that in the [Redux comparison](TODO:link). TL;DR effects subscribers are all you'll need. But you shouldn't need to rig them up manually. Zedux exposes a high-level API that can easily tap into a store's side effects layer:

```ts
import { when } from '@zedux/react'

const { subscription } = when(myStore)
  .stateChanges(logStateChange)
  .receivesAction(addTodo, sendPostRequest)
```

`when()` is a declarative and simple way to hook into stores. One of its primary use cases is registering `enter` and `leave` hooks for state machines:

```ts
when(myStore)
  .machine(({ activeState }) => activeState) // locate state machine
  .enters(ActiveState.Inactive, scheduleCleanup) // register onEnter hook
  .leaves(ActiveState.Inactive, destroy) // register onLeave hook
```
