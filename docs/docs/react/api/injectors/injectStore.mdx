import { LiveEditor } from '../../../LiveEditor'

```ts
import { injectStore } from '@zedux/react'
```

An [injector](../glossary#injector) that creates a stable [Zedux store](../classes/Store). This reference will not change on subsequent evaluations of this atom instance.

`injectStore` is the injector equivalent of both `useState` and `useReducer`, since Zedux stores cover both use cases (and more).

## Examples

<LiveEditor resultVar="Seconds">{`
const secondsAtom = atom('seconds', () => {
  const store = injectStore(0)\n
  injectEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(
      () => store.setState(val => val + 1),
      1000
    )\n
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId)
  }, [])\n
  return store
})\n
function Seconds() {
  const state = useAtomValue(secondsAtom)\n
  return <div>{state}</div>
}
`}</LiveEditor>

Miscellaneous:

```ts
import { createStore, injectStore } from '@zedux/react'

const zeroConfigStore = injectStore('initial state')
const createdManually = injectStore(() => createStore(null, 'initial state'))
const configuredStore = injectStore(() => createStore(rootReducer))

const composedStore = injectStore(() => createStore({
  zeroConfig: zeroConfigStore,
  configured: configuredStore
}))

const subscribingStore = injectStore('state', true)
```

## Signature

```ts
injectStore(initialValue?, shouldSubscribe?) => Store
```

### Overloads

```ts
injectStore(createStore?, shouldSubscribe?) => Store
```

### `initialValue`

Optional. Can be anything but a function. This value will be set as the initial state of the store.

To set a function as the value, you must use the [`createStore`](#createstore) overload:

```ts
injectStore(() => createStore(null, myFunctionHere))
```

Typically it isn't recommended to set a function as a store's value. But there are certainly use cases.

### `shouldSubscribe`

Optional. A boolean. Default `false`. Indicates whether the current atom instance should subscribe to this store.

Why does this default to `false`?? Doesn't that make this fundamentally different from React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks? It may be a confusing change at first. And we certainly could change the default to `true`.

Atom evaluations are much more predictable than React rerenders. The default is `false` to remind you that you have control! Many atoms won't need to reevaluate when their own store's state changes.

### `createStore`

Optional. A function that returns a manually-created store by calling [`createStore()`](../factories/createStore). This function will only be called once - when the atom instance is created.
