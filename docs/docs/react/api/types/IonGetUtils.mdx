The object Zedux passes as the first parameter to [ion getters](../factories/ion#get).

## Definition

```ts
interface IonGetUtils {
  ecosystem: Ecosystem

  get<A extends AtomBase<any, [], any>>(atom: A): AtomStateType<A>

  get<A extends AtomBase<any, [...any], any>>(
    atom: A,
    params: AtomParamsType<A>
  ): AtomStateType<A>

  get<I extends AtomInstanceBase<any, [...any], any>>(
    instance: I
  ): AtomInstanceStateType<I>

  getInstance<A extends AtomBase<any, [], any>>(atom: A): AtomInstanceType<A>

  getInstance<A extends AtomBase<any, any, any>>(
      atom: A,
      params: AtomParamsType<A>
    ): AtomInstanceType<A
}
```

### `ecosystem`

A reference to the [ecosystem](../classes/Ecosystem) this ion instance was created in.

### `get`

A function that returns the current state of an atom instance. You can pass either an instance directly or an atom and its params (if any).

```ts
({ get }) => get(otherAtom)
({ get }) => get(otherAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'])
({ get }) => get(anInstance)
```

When called synchronously during instance evaluation, `get` registers a [dynamic graph dependency](../glossary#dynamic-graph-dependency) on the resolved atom instance.

When called asynchronously (e.g. in an [`injectEffect`](../injectors/injectEffect)), it does not register a dependency; it simply returns the resolved atom instance's value.

### `getInstance`

A function that returns an atom instance. Pass an atom and its params (if any)

```ts
({ getInstance }) => getInstance(otherAtom)
({ getInstance }) => getInstance(otherAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'])
```

When called synchronously during instance evaluation, `getInstance` registers a [static graph dependency](../glossary#static-graph-dependency) on the resolved atom instance.

When called asynchronously (e.g. in an [`injectEffect`](../injectors/injectEffect)), it does not register a dependency; it simply returns the resolved atom instance.
