In Zedux, reducers are exactly the same as in Redux and React. A reducer is just a function that receives the current state and an [action](Action) and returns the new state.

[Stores](../classes/Store) can be configured with reducers by passing a reducer to [`createStore()`](../factories/createStore) or [`store.use()`](../classes/Store#use).

## Example

```ts
import { createStore } from '@zedux/react'

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return state + 1
  }

  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return state - 1
  }

  return state
}

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.getState() // 0
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'decrement' }) // 1
```

## Creation

While you can create reducers manually like we just did, Zedux exports a high-level [`createReducer()`] factory for creating them easily:

```ts
import { createReducer, createStore } from '@zedux/react'

const counterReducer = createReducer(0) // the initial state
  .reduce('increment', state => state + 1)
  .reduce('decrement', state => state - 1)

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.getState() // 0
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'decrement' }) // 1
```

## Definition

```ts
(currentState, action) => newState
```

Return the new state or the currentState if no change.

### `currentState`

Just exactly what it says... Can be any type. If creating reducers manually, be sure to default this value.

### `action`

An [action object](Action). The reducer should look at this action's `type` property to determine what to do.
