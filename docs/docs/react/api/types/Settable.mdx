The value passed to [`store.setState()`](../classes/Store#setstate), thus also the value passed to [`instance.setState()`](../classes/AtomInstance#setstate) and to [SetStateInterceptors](SetStateInterceptor) and [ion setters](../factories/ion#set).

## Definition

```ts
type Settable<State = any> = ((state: State) => State) | State
```

Can be either the state straight-up or a function that receives the current state and returns the new state

```ts
const store = createStore(null, 'initial state')

store.setState('new state')
store.setState(currentState => `${currentState} and then some`)
store.getState() // 'new state and then some'
```
