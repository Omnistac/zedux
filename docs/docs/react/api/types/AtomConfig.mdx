An AtomConfig object is the 3rd argument passed to [the `atom()` factory](../factories/atom).

## Definition

```ts
interface AtomConfig {
  flags?: string[]
  maxInstances?: number
  ttl?: number
}
```

### `flags`

Optional. An array of strings. These flags correlate to the [Ecosystem's `flags` property](../classes/Ecosystem#flags). See that page for an example.

### `maxInstances`

Optional. A number. Indicates the largest ideal cache size for this atom. See [AtomBase](../classes/AtomBase#maxinstances) for more info.

### `ttl`

Optional. A number. If set to 0, atom instances will be destroyed immediately upon going stale. If set to -1, atom instances will live forever, unless destroyed manually. If set to any positive integer, Zedux will wait `<ttl>` milliseconds before cleaning up the atom instance. If the atom instance is used during that time, cleanup is cancelled.
