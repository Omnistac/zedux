title: EcosystemConfig
---

The config object passed to [the `ecosystem()` factory](../factories/ecosystem).

## Definition

```ts
interface EcosystemConfig {
  destroyOnUnmount?: boolean
  flags?: string[]
  id?: string
  overrides?: AtomBase<any, any[], any>[]
  preload?: (ecosystem: Ecosystem) => void
}
```

All fields are optional. It is recommended to at least pass an id.

### `destroyOnUnmount`

Whether the ecosystem should destroy itself when its last [`<EcosystemProvider>`](../components/EcosystemProvider) unmounts. Useful for testing.

### `flags`

An array of strings. Will be set as the [ecosystem's flags](../classes/Ecosystem#flags).

### `id`

A string. Identifies the ecosystem in the [zeduxGlobalStore](../constants/zeduxGlobalStore) and in dev tools.

### `overrides`

An array of [atoms](../classes/Atom). Will be set as the [ecosystem's overrides](../classes/Ecosystem#overrides). Used for [Dependency Injection](../../walkthrough/dependency-injection).

### `preload`

A function. Will be called as soon as the ecosystem has initialized. Can be used to bootstrap data and preload atoms.
