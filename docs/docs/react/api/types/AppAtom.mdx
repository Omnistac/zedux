```ts
import { AppAtom } from '@zedux/react'
```

The most common atom. All atoms are AppAtoms by default unless otherwise specified.

When created inside an [`<AppProvider />`](../exports/AppProvider), app atom instances are scoped to that provider. AppProviders create completely isolated worlds for app atoms to live.

When created outside any AppProvider, app atom instances are actually global. This is ideal for simple, zero config, or default environments.

## Definition

App atoms are the default atom. They add nothing to the `AtomBase` type.

```ts
type AppAtom<State = any, Params extends any[] = []> = AtomBase<
  State,
  Params
>
```

**extends**

[`AtomBase`](AtomBase)
