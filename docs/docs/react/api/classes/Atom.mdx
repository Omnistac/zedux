Extends [StandardAtomBase](StandardAtomBase).

The standard, default atom type you'll use. Instances of this class are passed to most of Zedux' hooks and injectors.

An atom defines a template that Zedux will use to create atom instances. Do not confuse "atom instances" with instances of this Atom class! Atom instances are actually instances of [the AtomInstance class](AtomInstance) ðŸ¤•. We refer to instances of this Atom class as simply "atoms".

## Creation

Use [the `atom()` factory](../factories/atom) to create atoms:

```ts
import { Atom, atom } from '@zedux/react'

const exampleAtom = atom('example', 'initial state')

exampleAtom instanceof Atom // true
```

## Methods

This class exposes only one method apart from those inherited from [StandardAtomBase](StandardAtomBase).

### `.override`

Creates an exact clone of this atom, but with a different value.

```ts
.override(newValue) => Atom
```

#### `newValue`

Can be any of the same [six value types](../factories/atom#value) that `atom()` accepts.
