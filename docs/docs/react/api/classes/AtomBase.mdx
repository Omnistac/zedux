    The key is the key to Dependency Injection - it's how ecosystems know which atoms to override. It also serves as a dev tool - many errors will log the key of the atom they originated in. Keys also help with a codebase's grepability.

)

The abstract base class of all atoms.

## Properties

### `.internalId`

A string. Readonly. All atoms generate a basic, incrementing, unique id. Zedux uses this internally.

### `.key`

A string.

<AtomKeyDesc />

### `.flags`

An array of strings. May be undefined. The flags that will be checked alongside an [ecosystem's flags](Ecosystem#flags) to warn about unsafe atoms being used in certain environments.

### `.maxInstances`

A number. May be undefined. Indicates the largest ideal cache size of the atom.

When more than `maxInstances` number of atom instances of this atom are created in an ecosystem, Zedux' behavior will change regarding the cleanup of those instances. Zedux will ignore `ttl` and instantly clean up instances when they go stale until the number of instances is back within `maxInstances`.

## Extending

When creating your own, custom atom types, you'll usually want to extend either this class or [StandardAtomBase](StandardAtomBase). Creating your own atom types is an advanced feature and we're not currently documenting it as the internals of these classes may change.
