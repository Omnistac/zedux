## Installation

```bash
npm i zedux
```

Or include the appropriate unpkg build on your page (module exposed as `window.Zedux`):

**Development:**

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/zedux/dist/zedux.js"></script>
```

**Production:**

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/zedux/dist/zedux.min.js"></script>
```

Now you need a store.

## The Store

Zedux stores are just state containers. They hold a single value and help you enforce certain patterns to update that value. Creating one is simple:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const theSimplestStore = createStore()
```

Simple, yes, but filled with destiny.

## The Patterns

In Zedux there are two Core Patterns: The Zero Config Pattern and the Reducer Pattern. Each store should pick one or the other, but may be composed of any number of stores that use either pattern.

### The Zero Config Pattern

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const store = createStore().hydrate('some value')

store.subscribe((newState, oldState) => {
  console.log('state changed', { newState, oldState })
})

store.setState('a new value')
```

With Zero Config stores, we typically:

- Hydrate the store with its initial state.
- use `store.setState` to update the store's state

### The Reducer Pattern

```ts
import { createActor, createReducer, createStore } from 'zedux'

const setValue = createActor<string>('setValue')
const reducer = createReducer('some value')
  .reduce(setValue, (_, value) => value)

const store = createStore(reducer)

store.subscribe((newState, oldState) => {
  console.log('state changed', { newState, oldState })
})

store.dispatch(setValue('a new value'))
```

With Reducer stores, we typically:

- Create any number of reducers (functions that take the current state and an action)

## Machines Are Reducers

Zedux stores aren't required for every piece of state. But Zedux utilities can still come in handy when a store isn't needed. For example, in React a Zedux machine can be passed directly to `useReducer`:

```ts
import React, { useReducer } from 'react'
import { createMachine } from 'zedux'

const requestReducer = createMachine()
  .addTransition('idle', 'requesting')
  .addTransition('requesting', 'success')
  .addTransition('requesting', 'failure')

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(requestReducer, 'idle')

  ...

  // in some effect or callback or whatever:
  dispatch({ type: 'requesting' })
}
```
