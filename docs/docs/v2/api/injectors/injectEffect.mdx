```ts
import { injectEffect } from '@zedux/react'
```

An [injector](../glossary.mdx#injector) for running side effects in atoms. Similar to React's [`useEffect` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), it runs a callback function and optionally cleans up after it.

The effect will run on initial atom creation and re-run when any of the specified dependencies change on subsequent evaluations.

When a cleanup function is returned, it will be called when the effect is about to run again or when the atom is destroyed.

## Examples

Run an effect once on initial atom creation:

```tsx live ecosystemId=injectEffect/example resultVar=App version=2
const timerAtom = atom('timer', () => {
  const signal = injectSignal(0)

  injectEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      signal.set(count => count + 1)
    }, 1000)

    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }, [])

  return signal
})

function App() {
  const timer = useAtomValue(timerAtom)

  return <div>Timer: {timer} seconds</div>
}
```

Run an effect every time dependencies change:

```tsx live ecosystemId=injectEffect/dependencies resultVar=App version=2
const counterAtom = atom('counter', () => {
  const signal = injectSignal(0)
  const { status } = injectSelf()

  injectEffect(() => {
    if (status !== 'Initializing') {
      window.alert(`Value changed to: ${signal.get()}`)
    }
  }, [signal.get()])

  return signal
})

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtomState(counterAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(state => state + 1)}>
        Increment Count
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Effects Run When It's Safe

Proper effect timing is tricky to get right. To make effects as intuitive as possible, Zedux runs effects as soon as it detects that it's "safe" to do so:

- When an atom is created outside React, effects run immediately after the atom (and any other atoms it created) finishes evaluating.
- When an atom is created during a React render, effects run in a microtask after initial atom evaluation.

This ensures a few things:

- When using atoms outside React, especially in tests, effects can register event listeners before those events fire.
- When an atom is created during React render, effects don't cause bad React state updates during render.

The bottom line is that **you typically don't need to worry about effect timing**. However, there's one scenario that Zedux can't fully handle by itself: When a test `render`s a test component that creates an atom that has a side effect.

In this case, the effect(s) will be scheduled to run in a microtask (since the atom was created during a React render). Either wait for effects to flush or flush them manually before continuing the test:

- Wait for effects to flush:

  ```tsx
  const { findByTestId } = render(<MyTestApp />)

  await Promise.resolve() // wait for microtasks to flush
  ```

- Flush effects manually with [`ecosystem.asyncScheduler`](../classes/Ecosystem.mdx#asyncscheduler):

  ```tsx
  const { findByTestId } = render(<MyTestApp />)

  ecosystem.asyncScheduler.flush() // flush Zedux effects synchronously
  ```

  This is safe to run "just in case" whenever you know React isn't currently rendering. So consider baking this into a custom `render` function.

## You Might Not Need an Effect

Many of the principles in React's famous ["You Might Not Need an Effect" doc](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) apply to `injectEffect`.

### Transformations

You don't typically need effects to transform data. Prefer selectors or ions that naturally derive data. Or just do the transformation inline during atom evaluation if it's cheap. Also consider [`injectMemo`](./injectMemo.mdx) if it's less cheap.

Bad example:

```tsx
const multiplierAtom = atom('multiplier', 2)

const computedAtom = atom('computed', () => {
  const multiplier = injectAtomValue(multiplierAtom)
  const signal = injectSignal(0)

  // This is bad practice! You don't need an effect for this:
  injectEffect(() => {
    signal.set(10 * multiplier)
  }, [multiplier])

  return signal
})
```

Here are some better approaches:

- Use an [atom selector](../types/SelectorTemplate.mdx):

  ```tsx
  const getComputed = ({ get }: Ecosystem) => 10 * get(multiplierAtom)
  ```

- Derive the value directly in an [ion](../factories/ion.mdx):

  ```tsx
  const computedAtom = ion('computed', ({ get }) => {
    return 10 * get(multiplierAtom)
  })
  ```

- Derive the value directly in an atom:

  ```tsx
  const computedAtom = atom('computed', () => {
    const multiplier = injectAtomValue(multiplierAtom)

    return 10 * multiplier
  })
  ```

- Use [`injectMemo`](./injectMemo.mdx) if needed:

  ```tsx
  const computedAtom = atom('computed', () => {
    const multiplier = injectAtomValue(multiplierAtom)

    // this simple computation obviously doesn't need `injectMemo`
    return injectMemo(() => 10 * multiplier, [multiplier])
  })
  ```

- If the `computed` atom uses a signal for its state, set it during evaluation:

  ```tsx
  const computedAtom = atom('computed', () => {
    const multiplier = injectAtomValue(multiplierAtom)
    const signal = injectSignal(0)

    // if state doesn't change, `.set` is a no-op. So this call is safe. But if
    // this call could possibly change the state (e.g. if the signal's state is
    // an object), wrap this in an `if` statement to prevent an infinite
    // evaluation loop:
    signal.set(10 * multiplier)

    return signal
  ```

### Callbacks

Don't use effects to handle user events. Prefer callbacks that kick off side effects directly, avoiding the indirection of `injectEffect`.

Bad example:

```tsx
const usersAtom = atom('users', () => {
  const signal = injectSignal({ status: 'idle' })

  injectEffect(() => {
    if (signal.get().status === 'loading') {
      // fetch users here...
    }
  }, [signal.get().status])

  const fetchUsers = () => {
    // This is bad practice! You don't need to reroute execution to an effect
    signal.set({ status: 'loading' })
  }

  return api(signal).setExports({ fetchUsers })
})
```

Instead, kick off the side effect directly in the callback:

```tsx
const usersAtom = atom('users', () => {
  const signal = injectSignal({ status: 'idle' }

  const fetchUsers = async () => {
    signal.set({ status: 'loading' })
    // fetch users here...
  }

  return api(signal).setExports({ fetchUsers })
})
```

### Async State

Additionally, in Zedux, consider using [`injectPromise`](/not-done?path=./injectPromise.mdx) or [query atoms](../../../walkthrough/query-atoms.mdx) instead of `injectEffect` to run async operations and track their state.

<Tabs>
  {tab1(`injectEffect = (callback, deps?, config?) => void`)}
  {tab2(`declare const injectEffect: (effect: EffectCallback, deps?: InjectorDeps, config?: {
    synchronous?: boolean;
}) => void`)}
</Tabs>

<Legend>
  <Item name="callback">
    Required. A function that contains the side effect logic. Can optionally return a cleanup function that will be called when the effect is cleaned up.

  </Item>
  <Item name="deps">
    Optional. An array of dependencies. The effect will re-run when any dependency changes.
    
    If not provided, the effect runs after every atom evaluation. If an empty array `[]` is provided, the effect only runs once when the atom is first created.
    
  </Item>
  <Item name="config">
    Optional. An object with the following properties:

    ```ts
    { synchronous? }
    ```

    - `synchronous`: A boolean. If `true`, the effect runs immediately, during atom evaluation. Defaults to `false`.

    You typically don't need this! Zedux is very intelligent about when it runs effects. See [above](#effects-run-when-its-safe).
