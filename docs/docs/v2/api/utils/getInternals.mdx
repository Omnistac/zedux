```ts
import { getInternals } from '@zedux/react'
```

A utility function that returns Zedux's internal state. This is primarily used for advanced use cases like sharing state between multiple Zedux instances or debugging.

:::warning Advanced Usage
This is an advanced utility that exposes Zedux internals. Use with caution and only when necessary.
:::

Pass the returned internals object to [`setInternals`](./setInternals.mdx) e.g. in a child window or iframe to share state between multiple Zedux instances. Note that you'll typically want to share your [ecosystem(s)](../classes/Ecosystem.mdx) as well.

## Example

```tsx live ecosystemId=getInternals/example resultVar=App version=2
function App() {
  const showInternals = () => {
    const internals = getInternals()
    console.log('Current evaluation context:', internals.c)
    console.log('Default ecosystem:', internals.g)
    console.log('Ecosystem ID:', internals.g.id)
  }

  return <button onClick={showInternals}>Log Internals (check console)</button>
}
```

## Signature

<Tabs>
  {tab1(`getInternals = () => internals`)}
  {tab2(`declare const getInternals: () => {
    c: EvaluationContext
    g: Ecosystem
  }`)}
</Tabs>

<Legend>

  <Item name="Returns">
    An object containing two obfuscated internal objects:
    
    - **`c`** - The current evaluation context. This is how [injectors](../glossary.mdx#injector) and other utilities like [`ecosystem.why`](../classes/Ecosystem.mdx#why) work.
    - **`g`** - The default ecosystem instance. Note that calling `getInternals` creates this if it hasn't been created yet.
  </Item>
