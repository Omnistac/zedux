While Zedux is designed to be extremely useful out of the box, that doesn't mean it handles everything. Plugins satisfy the extremes of hackability.

We know Zedux stores don't take middleware and we already know how to hook into a store's side effects layer using effects subscribers. But these are passive hooks. Sometimes you need more active control over state flow.

Zedux doesn't offer a dedicated plugin system at the store level at all. In Zedux, plugins live on the ecosystem.
