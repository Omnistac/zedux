One of the great patterns that Redux popularized is the ability to undo and redo state updates in your app. Earlier flux models didn't have this capability because they split state up across multiple stores. Well Zedux reintroduces the concept of multiple stores, so does that mean it loses out on time travel?

Zedux also introduces the concept of zero-config stores. In Redux, the boilerplate-heavy action-reducer model is central to its time traveling ability. Surely zero-config Zedux stores can't time travel... Can they?

As you can probably guess by the existence of this walkthrough page, the answer is that Zedux fully supports time travel. Let's Learn Everything.

:::tip you will learn:

- How Zedux' powerful store composition model enables time travel.
- How to implement undo/redo for individual stores, atoms, or an entire ecosystem.
