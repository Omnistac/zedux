title: Introducing Zedux
---

Zedux is a flexible, multi-paradigm state management tool for React. It's packed with features covering all aspects of state management.

## Features

- Atomic architecture
- Global state management
- Local (component, "fractal") state management
- High-level abstractions for React context
- Standardized Dependency Injection
- Cache management
- State machines
- Selectors
- Zero-configuration
- Dev, debugging, and performance tools

## Project Goals

1. Flexibility.
2. Depth.
3. Simplicity.

### Flexibility

The core philosophy of Zedux. Atoms and stores are flexible, meaning they can adapt to every use case. Need more power? Build a reducer hierarchy. Need some simple, local state? Use zero config stores. Need something even simpler? Don't use stores at all!

Apps of all sizes should be able to use Zedux comfortably. Zedux is designed to scale as your state management demands increase. Zero configuration can always be opted out of. All high-level APIs have low-level counterparts for when you need to dig in and do something crazy.

### Depth

Zedux is not just another "80%" little state management library that fills some niche and gets people excited for a while. It's a mature tool that yields greater returns the more you use it and spend time learning its features.

Zedux doesn't leave you reaching for other libraries to fill the holes in your state management needs. Rather, it tries to be as complete as possible while not rewriting everything. Zedux is not on a byte diet but is still pretty small.

Knowledge gained from working with Zedux is transferrable. Zedux tries to stay close to other popular libraries in the space. The atomic APIs are similar to Recoil. The store APIs are similar to Redux. The cache management tools are similar to React Query. If one day you ditch Zedux forever, you should be able to easily jump into other libraries and feel familiar with the concepts.

### Simplicity

Zero configuration and high-level APIs are standard across all features. A few simple lines of code is all you need to learn to start using Zedux. In fact, here they are:

```tsx
import { atom, useAtomState } from '@zedux/react'

const myFirstAtom = atom('myFirst', 'Hello, world!')

function MyComponent() {
  const [state] = useAtomState(myFirstAtom)

  return <div>A message from the universe: {state}</div>
}
```

## I Have Bundlephobia

The production build of Zedux currently weighs in at 48kb minified, 14kb minified + gzipped - very similar to other libraries in the space like Redux Toolkit and React Query.

## Next Steps

The [walkthrough](../walkthrough/quick-start) is a great place to start learning Zedux. It offers a good balance of practical usage and depth to help you feel comfortable using Zedux.
