title: Recoil Comparison

Zedux' atomic model was born in 2020 shortly after Recoil started gaining traction. We liked Recoil, but were turned away mostly by its complexity and (then-)unstable effects model. By borrowing ideas from React Query and React itself and by using Zedux' existing composable store model, we were able to create an atomic model that we've found more beginner-friendly and powerful.

## Atom/Selector Families

Recoil distinguishes between `atom`, `selector`, `atomFamily`, and `selectorFamily`. Zedux' [`atom`](../api/factories/atom) alone replaces all 4, though Zedux also provides [`ion`](../api/factories/ion) which is more commonly used to replace `selector`/`selectorFamily`.

Recoil:

```tsx
const myNumberState = atom({
  key: 'MyNumber',
  default: 2,
})

const myMultipliedState = selectorFamily({
  key: 'MyMultipliedNumber',
  get: multiplier => ({ get }) => {
    return get(myNumberState) * multiplier
  },
})

function MyComponent() {
  const number = useRecoilValue(myNumberState)
  const multipliedNumber = useRecoilValue(myMultipliedState(100))

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

Zedux:

```tsx
const myNumberState = atom('myNumber', 2)

const myMultipliedState = ion(
  'myMultipliedNumber',
  ({ get }, multiplier: number) => {
    return get(myNumberState) * multiplier
  }
)

function MyComponent() {
  const number = useAtomValue(myNumberState)
  const multipliedNumber = useAtomValue(myMultipliedState, [100])

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

You can think of every atom as an "atom family" in Zedux. Params are used to create different atom instances ("family members"). Atoms that don't take params will be a "family" of size one (aka a singleton).

Zedux relies on TypeScript to yell at you if you pass the wrong params or forget to pass them.

```ts
// using the above `myMultipliedState` ion, the following are all TS errors:
useAtomValue(myMultipliedState) // no params
useAtomValue(myMultipliedState, ['bad']) // string instead of number
useAtomValue(myMultipliedState, [100, 'bad']) // wrong number of params
```

## Selectors

Recoil selectors are a sort of more advanced atom-that-isn't-an-atom. Zedux selectors come in many flavors:

- Any atom can inject any other atom
- AtomSelectors are light-weight functions that hook into the atoms universe
- Ions are an atom/AtomSelector hybrid

Recoil:

```tsx
const filteredTodoListState = selector({
  key: 'FilteredTodoList',
  get: ({ get }) => {
    const filter = get(todoListFilterState)
    const list = get(todoListState)

    switch (filter) {
      case 'Show Completed':
        return list.filter(item => item.isComplete)
      case 'Show Uncompleted':
        return list.filter(item => !item.isComplete)
      default:
        return list
    }
  },
})
```

Zedux (using an AtomSelector):

```tsx
const getFilteredTodoList = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => {
  const filter = get(todoListFilterAtom)
  const list = get(todoListAtom)

  switch (filter) {
    case 'Show Completed':
      return list.filter(item => item.isComplete)
    case 'Show Uncompleted':
      return list.filter(item => !item.isComplete)
    default:
      return list
  }
}
```

Zedux (using an Ion):

```tsx
const filteredTodoListIon = ion('filteredTodoList', ({ get }) => {
  const filter = get(todoListFilterAtom)
  const list = get(todoListAtom)

  switch (filter) {
    case 'Show Completed':
      return list.filter(item => item.isComplete)
    case 'Show Uncompleted':
      return list.filter(item => !item.isComplete)
    default:
      return list
  }
})
```

## Effects

In Recoil, effects are isolated functions with special syntax for every basic operation.

In Zedux, side effects are handled exactly as you'd handle them in React - using an exported callback if possible for optimal render-as-you-fetch concurrent mode goodness, or using `injectEffect` to predictably react to state updates.

Recoil:

```tsx
const localStorageEffect = key => ({ setSelf, onSet }) => {
  const savedValue = localStorage.getItem(key)
  if (savedValue != null) {
    setSelf(JSON.parse(savedValue))
  }

  onSet(newValue => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(newValue))
  })
}

const currentUserIDState = atom({
  key: 'CurrentUserID',
  default: 1,
  effects: [localStorageEffect('current_user')],
})
```

Zedux (using exported callbacks - recommended):

```tsx
const key = 'current_user'

const currentUserIdAtom = atom('currentUserId', () => {
  const savedValue = localStorage.getItem(key)
  const store = injectStore(savedValue != null ? JSON.parse(savedValue) : 1)

  const updateId = (newId: number) => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(newId))
    store.setState(newId)
  }

  return api(store).setExports({ updateId })
})
```

Zedux (using `injectEffect`):

```tsx
const key = 'current_user'

const currentUserIdAtom = atom('currentUserId', () => {
  const savedValue = localStorage.getItem(key)
  const store = injectStore(savedValue != null ? JSON.parse(savedValue) : 1)
  const currentState = store.getState()

  // injectEffect works just like React's useEffect!
  injectEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(currentState))
  }, [currentState])

  return store
})
```

## Bundle Size

Despite having many extra features like state machines, the composable store model, ecosystems, and DI overrides, Zedux is actually significantly smaller than Recoil. Currently:

- Recoil 78kb minified
- Zedux 45kb minified

Granted, we expect Zedux to grow a little and Recoil to shrink if it drops support for older React versions.

## Synchronous Evaluation

Recoil atoms handle promises implicitly. The goal is to make it so you "don't have to think about it", but in our experience that isn't the case. A big asynchronous graph can get very difficult to reason about and we found ourselves using the `waitForAll`/`waitForAllSettled`/`waitForNone`/`waitForAny` helpers more and more and wanting more advanced control e.g. using RxJS to buffer socket messages and flush on an interval.

Zedux atoms always evaluate synchronously. While Zedux has several helpers for handling promises, state factories themselves can't be asynchronous. This means you always get the default value when using an atom that may be waiting for its data. That in turn means you may need to explicitly:

- handle `null`/`undefined`/`isLoading` states until data comes in.
- control asynchronous flows using `Promise.all`/`Promise.race` or any async helper library like RxJS.

Zedux does have React suspense support. But as far as managing asynchronous state between atoms, Zedux suffers from all the age-old async difficulties - imperative state, race conditions, etc. But this was a conscious decision we made because it gives you full control. Modern tooling and some of Zedux' own helpers should make async state manageable.

While this seems like it would be undesirable, we've come to prefer it. Zedux' initial atom PoC used implicit suspense-like promise handling and we really didn't like it. Our key takeaways:

- Explicit is good
- Reinventing the async wheel is bad

Specifically the ability to use observables inside atoms is a real game changer:

```tsx
const zeduxPlusRxEqualsLove = atom('❤️', () => {
  // simple example accumulating all socket emissions into an array:
  const store = injectStore([])
  const mySocket$ = injectAtomValue(mySocketAtom)

  // yes, you can even abstract this out to a custom `injectSocket` injector!
  injectEffect(() => {
    const subscription = mySocket$.subscribe(val =>
      store.setState(state => [...state, val])
    )

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  }, [mySocket$])

  return store
})
```

## Resetting State

Recoil has a concept of resetting atoms. Zedux doesn't provide a "reset", but anything can be invalidated or force-destroyed (triggering recreation if needed). You can also fine-tune control over resets using exports or creating a dedicated `resetStreamAtom` that any atom can hook into to handle global reset events.

Recoil:

```tsx
const todoListState = atom({
  key: 'TodoList',
  default: [],
})

const TodoResetButton = () => {
  const resetList = useResetRecoilState(todoListState)

  return <button onClick={resetList}>Reset</button>
}
```

Zedux (using [`instance.invalidate()`](../api/classes/AtomInstance#invalidate) on an atom with no dependencies):

```tsx
const todoListAtom = atom('todoList', () => [])

const TodoResetButton = () => {
  const { invalidate } = useAtomInstance(todoListAtom)

  return <button onClick={invalidate}>Reset</button>
}
```

See more ways to reset state in Zedux in [the resets walkthrough](../walkthrough/resets).

## Conclusion

Most of these differences are honestly not that significant and come down to personal preference. Recoil's promise handling can be very cool if it works for you. The ability to attach exports to atoms in Zedux is very powerful. There are tons of little differences, but:

Overall, we designed Zedux to handle _more_ use cases. Everything, in fact. If you're worried about Recoil becoming too restrictive as your app scales, Zedux might be a good fit for you.
