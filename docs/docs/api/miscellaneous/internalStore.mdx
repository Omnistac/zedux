```ts
import { internalStore } from '@zedux/react'
```

Zedux creates a store internally to keep track of all ecosystems. Ecosystems are mutable objects with functions and circular references and all sorts of non-Reduxy patterns. This is by design - for performance and efficiency. But it means you can't use this global store to track state changes like in a normal, immutable flow.

Plugins can subscribe to this store to see when ecosystems are created and destroyed. You can also use this to inspect the internal state of Zedux. Readonly!

```ts
import { createEcosystem, internalStore } from '@zedux/react'

const rootEcosystem = createEcosystem({ id: 'root' })

internalStore.getState()
// {
//   ecosystems: {
//     root: rootEcosystem
//   }
// }

const subscription = internalStore.subscribe((newState, oldState) => {
  const newKeys = Object.keys(newState)
  const oldKeys = oldState ? Object.keys(oldState) : []

  const newEcosystems = newKeys.filter(key => !oldKeys.includes(key))
  const destroyedEcosystems = oldKeys.filter(key => !newKeys.includes(key))
})
```
