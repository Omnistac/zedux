```ts
import { internalStore } from '@zedux/react'
```

Zedux creates a store internally to keep track of all ecosystems. Ecosystems are mutable objects with functions and circular references and all sorts of non-Reduxy patterns. This is by design - for performance and efficiency. But it means you can't use this global store to track state changes like in a normal, immutable flow.

Plugins can subscribe to this store to see when ecosystems are created and destroyed. You can also use this to inspect the internal state of Zedux. Readonly!

```ts
import { internalStore } from '@zedux/react'

internalStore.getState() // { ecosystems: <a record of all ecosystems> }
```
