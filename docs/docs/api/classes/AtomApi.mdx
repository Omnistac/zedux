Atom APIs Dynamically define certain integral properties of an atom. These properties do not fit well in the [injector paradigm](../glossary#injector), as they define key characteristics of the atom itself.

These properties include an atom's exports, suspense promise, and custom TTL configuration.

All properties added to an AtomApi except the value and promise should be stable references. `.value` and `.promise` are the only properties that won't be ignored on subsequent evaluations.

:::note
The properties don't _have_ to be stable; Zedux will just ignore the new references on subsequent evaluations.

## Creation

Create AtomApis with [the `api()` factory](../factories/api).

```ts
import { api } from '@zedux/react'

const myApi = api()
const withValue = api('some value')
const withStore = api(createStore())
const withExports = api(val).setExports({ ...myExports })
const withPromise = api(val).setPromise(myPromise)
const fromApi = api(myApi)
const addingExports = api(withExports).addExports({ ...moreExports })
const overwritingExports = api(withExports).setExports({ ...newExports })
```

## Usage

AtomApis can be passed to `atom()` as the value. They can also be returned from an evaluator function.

```ts
import { api, atom, injectStore } from '@zedux/react'

const myAtom = atom('my', api('initial state'))

const withEvaluator = atom('withEvaluator', () => {
  return api('initial state')
})

const withStore = atom('withStore', () => {
  const store = injectStore('initial state')

  return api(store)
})

const withExports = atom('withExports', () => {
  const store = injectStore('initial state')

  return api(store).setExports({
    someProp: 'some val',
  })
})

const composingApis = atom('composingApis', () => {
  const injectedApi = injectSomethingThatReturnsAnApi()

  return api(injectedApi).addExports({
    additionalExport: 'some val',
  })
})
```

## Properties

AtomApis expose the following properties:

### `.exports`

The object of the exports added to this AtomApi via [`.setExports()`](#setexports) and/or [`.addExports()`](#addexports). May be undefined.

### `.promise`

A promise that Zedux will use to cause React to suspend everywhere this atom instance is used until the promise resolves. Set this via [`.setPromise()`](#setpromise).

### `.ttl`

An [AtomInstanceTtl](../types/AtomInstanceTtl) or a function that returns an AtomInstanceTtl. If a function, it will be called when Zedux schedules this atom instance's destruction. Will override any ecosystem- or atom-level ttl for this atom instance.

### `.value`

A reference to the value passed to [the `api()` factory](../factories/api). Can be either a raw value or a [Zedux store](Store).

If it's a store and this AtomApi is returned from an evaluator function, the store should be a stable reference that won't change on subsequent evaluations, e.g. by using [`injectStore()`](../injectors/injectStore).

## Methods

AtomApis expose the following methods:

### `.addExports`

Accepts an object. The object can contain anything, though all properties should be stable references - memoized functions or ref objects that won't change on subsequent evaluations. Returns the AtomApi for chaining.

Merges the passed object into any already-set [exports](#exports) on this AtomApi. If no exports have been set on this AtomApi, sets the exports.

```ts
const initialExports = api(val).addExports({ ...myExports })
const addedExports = api(val)
  .setExports({ ...myExports })
  .addExports({ ...moreExports })
```

### `.setExports`

Accepts an object. The object can contain anything, though all properties should be stable references - memoized functions or ref objects that won't change on subsequent evaluations. Returns the AtomApi for chaining.

Overwrites any previously-set exports on this AtomApi

```ts
const initialExports = api(val).setExports({ ...myExports })
const overwriteExports = api(initialExports).setExports({ ...newExports })
```

### `.setPromise`

Accepts a promise. Returns the AtomApi for chaining.

Sets the [`.promise`](#promise) property of this AtomApi. If this AtomApi is returned from an evaluator, the promise will be set as the atom instance's promise and will be used to cause React to suspend.

This promise should be a stable reference. If you create a new promise on a subsequent reevaluation, Zedux will ignore it.

### `.setTtl`

Accepts an [AtomInstanceTtl](../types/AtomInstanceTtl) or a function that returns an AtomInstanceTtl. If a function, it will be called when Zedux schedules this atom instance's destruction.

Sets the [`.ttl`](#ttl) property of this AtomApi. Overrides any `ttl` set on this [atom](Atom#ttl) or any default ttl on this [ecosystem](Ecosystem#defaultttl).
