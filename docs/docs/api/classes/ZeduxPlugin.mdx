The base class of Zedux [ecosystem](Ecosystem) plugins.

A plugin can turn on ecosystem mods and hook into mod events. Mod events are just [action objects](../types/Action) containing info about stuff happening inside the ecosystem.

Plugins set up a sort of bidirectional stream with ecosystems:

- Plugins expose a `modStore` for ecosystems to subscribe to. This allows plugins to dynamically turn the mods they need on and off.
- Ecosystems expose a `modBus` for plugins to subscribe to.

This class also has a single static property - `actions`. This is an object mapping every available mod to an [action factory](../types/ActionFactory) that Zedux uses to dispatch mod events to plugins.

```ts live resultVar=allMods
// Easy way to see all available mods:
const allMods = Object.keys(ZeduxPlugin.actions)
```

:::note
Mods have some overhead. That's why they're disabled by default. Turning them all on is _probably_ not recommended in production builds of bigger apps. Dev tools might want them all on and that's _probably_ fine in development.
:::

## Example

```ts
const plugin = new ZeduxPlugin({
  initialMods: ['stateChanged'],

  registerEcosystem: ecosystem => {
    const subscription = ecosystem.modBus.subscribe({
      effects: ({ action }) => {
        if (action.type === ZeduxPlugin.actions.stateChanged.type) {
          // handle stateChanged mod event
        }
      },
    })

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  },
})

const ecosystem = createEcosystem({ id: 'root' })
ecosystem.registerPlugin(plugin)
```

This should seem a little busy compared to most of Zedux's APIs. There is lots of room for abstracting some functionality, but for now we're keeping plugins intentionally low-level.

## Creating

Plugins are a little lower-level. This is the only class in Zedux that you insantiate using the `new` keyword.

```ts
const myPlugin = new ZeduxPlugin()
```

The constructor takes an optional config object:

<Ts>{`{ initialMods, registerEcosystem }`}</Ts>

{<Legend>
  <Item name="initialMods">
    <p>Optional. An array of mod strings.</p>
    <p>
      These don't need to be set initially. You can modify this list at any time
      by changing the state of your plugin's <code>modStore</code>:
    </p>
    <Ts>{`const plugin = new ZeduxPlugin()
plugin.modStore.setState({ stateChanged: true })
// This is equivalent to:
const plugin = new ZeduxPlugin({ initialMods: ['stateChanged'] })`}</Ts>
  </Item>
  <Item name="registerEcosystem">
    <p>
      Optional. A function that receives the ecosystem and can do anything with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>Signature:</p>
    <Ts>{`registerEcosystem = (ecosystem) => optionalCleanup`}</Ts>
    <p>
      You can return a cleanup function to clean up subscriptions when the
      plugin is unregistered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where you do all the plugin magic. Almost all plugins will pass
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your plugin turns on any mods, you'll likely want to subscribe to the
      ecosystem's{' '}
      <Link to="Ecosystem#modbus">
        <code>modBus</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      to handle those mod events.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}

## Properties

Every ZeduxPlugin has just two properties:

{<Legend>
  <Item name="modStore">
    <p>
      A <Link to="Store">Zedux store</Link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This store's state is an array of mod names. If a mod is in this list, it
      will be turned on in ecosystems where this plugin is registered. By
      default, this array is empty, unless you pass a list of initialMods.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change this store's state at any time to turn mods on/off in the
      ecosystem. When no plugins depend on a given mod, Zedux turns it off.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="registerEcosystem">
    A reference to the <code>registerEcosystem</code> function passed to the
    ZeduxPlugin constructor or a no-op function if none was passed.
  </Item>
</Legend>}

## Mod Details

{<Legend>
  <Item name="ecosystemWiped">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event when the ecosystem is wiped
      (usually as part of a <Link to="Ecosystem#reset">reset</Link>).
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  ecosystem: Ecosystem
}`}</Ts>
  </Item>
  <Item name="edgeCreated">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event every time an edge is created in
      the ecosystem's graph. This edge represents a dependency between two nodes
      in the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod can also be used to determine when an edge has "moved" after a
      dependency was force-destroyed. Since no <code>edgeRemoved</code> events
      are sent for edges between a force-destroyed node and its dependents, a
      plugin's internal graph representation would still have those edges intact
      when the new <code>edgeCreated</code> events come in after the dependency
      is recreated. These <code>edgeCreated</code> events will thus appear to be
      duplicates. When this happens, you can infer that the edge was "moved".
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  dependency: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache
  dependent: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache | string
  edge: DependentEdge
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      <code>dependent</code> will be a string if it's a "pseudo-node" in the
      graph, representing an external dependent like a React component.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll usually pair this mod with <code>edgeRemoved</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="edgeRemoved">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event every time an edge is removed from
      the ecosystem's graph. This edge represents a dependency between two nodes
      in the graph.
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  dependency: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache
  dependent: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache | string
  edge: DependentEdge
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      <code>dependent</code> will be a string if it's a "pseudo-node" in the
      graph, representing an external dependent like a React component.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll usually pair this mod with <code>edgeCreated</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="evaluationFinished">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event every time an atom instance or
      selector in the ecosystem finishes evaluating. This mod makes Zedux track
      evaluation time of every atom instance and selector.
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  node: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache
  time: number
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      <code>node</code> is either an instance of{' '}
      <Link to="AtomInstance">
        <code>AtomInstance</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      or{' '}
      <Link to="SelectorCache">
        <code>SelectorCache</code>
      </Link>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>time</code> will be a DOMHighResTimestamp measured in milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this uses{' '}
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >
        <code>performance.now()</code>
      </a>{' '}
      when available in the global scope. In other envs, it will fall back to
      using a non-high-res timestamp via <code>Date.now()</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="instanceReused">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event every time an existing atom
      instance is reused anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod <i>might</i> be useful to find problematic duplicate atom keys.
      Though HMR/React Fast Refresh complicates this. Plugins can ignore
      overrides created via{' '}
      <Link to="AtomTemplate">
        <code>template.override()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      by checking <code>template._isOverride</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  instance: AnyAtomInstance
  template: AnyAtomTemplate
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      <code>instance</code> references the existing atom instance being reused.{' '}
      <code>template</code> is the atom template used to find the instance on
      this particular call.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="stateChanged">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive a mod event every time an atom instance's
      state or an atom selector's cached result changes.
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  action?: ActionChain
  cache?: SelectorCache
  instance?: AnyAtomInstance
  newState: any
  oldState: any
  reasons: EvaluationReason[]
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      Either <code>cache</code> or <code>instance</code> will always be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the atom or selector reevaluated due to this state change,{' '}
      <code>reasons</code> will be set to the list of{' '}
      <Link to="../types/EvaluationReason">EvaluationReasons</Link> explaining
      the evaluation. Otherwise it will be empty.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="statusChanged">
    <p>
      Turn this mod on to receive mod events every time an atom instance's{' '}
      <Link to="AtomInstance#status">
        <code>status</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      property transitions to a new state (e.g. from Initializing to Active or
      from Active to Stale).
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod also triggers messages when selector caches are finished
      initializing and when selector caches are destroyed. Selectors don't track
      their lifecycle like atom instances do, but the <code>newStatus</code> and{' '}
      <code>oldStatus</code> fields for these events will be LifeCycle strings
      exactly like the strings used for atom instances.
    </p>
    <p>Payload shape:</p>
    <Ts>{`{
  node: AnyAtomInstance | SelectorCache
  newStatus: LifecycleStatus
  oldStatus: LifecycleStatus
}`}</Ts>
    <p>
      <code>node</code> will be either an atom instance or an atom selector. You
      can use{' '}
      <Link to="../utils/is">
        <code>is()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      to determine which.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>oldStatus</code> will be one of "Active", "Initializing", or "Stale"
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>newStatus</code> will be one of "Initializing", "Stale", or
      "Destroyed"
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that atom selectors can never be "Stale". Their lifecycle essentially
      goes <code>Initializing -&gt; Active -&gt; Destroyed</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}
