Extends [Atom](Atom).

Ions are a specialized atom type. They excel at selector-type operations. The only difference is that an ion's [state factory](../glossary#state-factory) receives an [AtomGetters object](../types/AtomGetters) as its first parameter. All other params work exactly the same as normal atom params.

Unlike atoms, ions _must_ be given a state factory function. That's the whole point!

## Creation

Create ions using [the `ion()` factory](../factories/ion).

```ts
import { ion } from '@zedux/react'

const selectorAtom = ion('selector', ({ get }) => get(otherAtom).someField)
const derivedAtom = ion('derived', ({ get }) => deriveStuff(get(otherAtom)))

const withParams = ion('withParams', ({ get }, one: string, two: number) => {
  return `${one} ${two}`
})

const withInjectors = ion('withInjectors', ({ get }) => {
  // any injector can be used in the "getter" function.
  const val = injectMemo(() => getExpensiveVal(), [])

  return val
})

const withConfig = ion('withConfig', stateFactory, {
  flags: ['my-flag'],
  ttl: 0,
})
```

Ions expose no unique properties or methods besides those exposed by [Atom](Atom).
