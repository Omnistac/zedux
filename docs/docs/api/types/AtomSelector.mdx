import { LiveEditor } from '../../LiveEditor'

A function that receives an [AtomGetters](AtomGetters) object as its first parameter. It can take any number of other parameters and can return anything. It can use the AtomGetters to get atom values and run other AtomSelectors.

This is the most basic tool for deriving state in Zedux. The [selectors walkthrough](../../walkthrough/selectors) teaches the basics of AtomSelectors. This page will only cover a few things the walkthrough doesn't.

AtomSelectors define a blueprint for pulling data from atoms. Similar to [reselect selectors](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#api), they don't do anything until someone calls them. You "call" them by passing them to various functions:

- [`useAtomSelector()`](../hooks/useAtomSelector)
- [`injectAtomSelector()`](../injectors/injectAtomSelector)
- [`ecosystem.select()`](../classes/Ecosystem#select)
- The `select` function of other AtomSelectors (composition!)

You can also call them directly, passing an AtomGetters object. There is [one situation](#generic-atomselectors) where this can be necessary

:::tip
Use AtomSelectors for:

- Dynamically registering graph edges in components
- Getting part of an atom instance's state
- Simple calculations that don't need memoization

:::

## Definition

```ts
type AtomSelector<T = any, Args extends any[] = []> = (
  getters: AtomGetters,
  ...args: Args
) => T

interface AtomSelectorConfig<T = any, Args extends any[] = []> {
  argsComparator?: (newArgs: Args, oldArgs: Args) => boolean
  resultsComparator?: (newResult: T, oldResult: T) => boolean
  selector: AtomSelector<T, Args>
}

type AtomSelectorOrConfig<T = any, Args extends any[] = []> =
  | AtomSelector<T, Args>
  | AtomSelectorConfig<T, Args>
```

## Examples

AtomSelectors are extremely flexible. They can be used and composed in many ways.

```ts
// basic derivation
const finishedTodos = ({ get }) => get(todosAtom).filter(todo => todo.isDone)
const uninishedTodos = ({ get }) => get(todosAtom).filter(todo => !todo.isDone)

// composition using select()
const separatedTodos = ({ select }) => {
  const finished = select(finishedTodos)
  const unfinished = select(unfinishedTodos)

  return { finished, unfinished }
}

// passing params
const getTodos = ({ select }, isDone) => {
  const todos = select(isDone ? finishedTodos : unfinishedTodos)
}

const separatedTodosWithParams = ({ select }) => {
  const finished = select(getTodos, true)
  const unfinished = select(getTodos, false)

  return { finished, unfinished }
}

// in useAtomSelector()
const withHook = useAtomSelector(finishedTodos)

// in injectAtomSelector()
const withInjector = injectAtomSelector(finishedTodos)

// in ecosystem.select()
const staticViaEcosystem = ecosystem.select(finishedTodos)

// directly in ion body (not recommended)
const exampleIon = ion('example', getters => {
  const todos = finishedTodos(getters)
})

// only run selector once
const stateSnapshot = useAtomSelector({
  // argsComparator isn't called on the first run
  argsComparator: () => true,
  selector: mySelector,
})

// only run the selector if the new args don't deep match the old args
const limitedRuns = useAtomSelector(
  {
    argsComparator: _.isEqual,
    selector: mySelector,
  },
  arg1,
  arg2
)

// only trigger updates if the new result doesn't deep match the old result
const limitedUpdates = useAtomSelector({
  resultsComparator: _.isEqual,
  selector: mySelector,
})
```

## When Not to Use

AtomSelectors aren't atoms. As such, you can't use [injectors](../glossary#injector) in them. [Ions](../classes/Ion) (or other atoms) should be preferred when you need:

- To memoize anything - use an atom with [`injectMemo()`](../injectors/injectMemo)
- To create and update a new store - use an atom with [`injectStore()`](../injectors/injectStore)
- To run side effects based on state updates - use an atom with [`injectEffect()`](../injectors/injectEffect)

### Converting AtomSelectors

AtomSelectors are simple and have little overhead, hence it's usually desirable to try an AtomSelector first for most tasks. However, sometimes you'll find out later that an AtomSelector needs functionality only atoms have.

Since AtomSelectors are so similar to ions, it's easy to convert an AtomSelector to an ion or a hook or injector.

```ts
// before:
const getSortedList = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => [...get(listAtom)].sort()

// after (as ion):
const sortedList = ion('sortedList', ({ get }) => {
  const list = get(listAtom)
  return injectMemo(() => [...list].sort(), [list]) // now we can memoize!
})

// after (as injector):
const injectTruthy = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => {
  const list = get(listAtom)
  return injectMemo(() => [...list].sort(), [list])
}
```

If refactoring the AtomSelector is too much work or too tedious or risky, you can also create an ion that simply wraps the existing AtomSelector:

```ts
// before
const getSortedList = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => [...get(listAtom)].sort()

// (before usage):
const sortedList = useAtomSelector(getSortedList)

// after
const getSortedListImpl = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => [...get(listAtom)].sort()

const getSortedList = ion('getSortedList', ({ select }) =>
  select(getSortedListImpl)
)

// (after usage):
const sortedList = useAtomValue(getSortedList)
```

## Generic AtomSelectors

In TypeScript, AtomSelectors that take a generic may need to be called directly to get correct type inference.

```ts
// with this AtomSelector:
const addExtraData = <T>({ get }: AtomGetters, list: T[]) => {
  return list.map(item => ({
    ...item,
    extraData: get(extraDataAtom)[item.id],
  }))
}

// it would be nice if you could:
const withExtraData = useAtomSelector(addExtraData, list)

// but you probably need to:
const withExtraData = useAtomSelector(getters => addExtraData(getters, list))
```

## AtomSelectorConfig

Everywhere Zedux accepts an AtomSelector, it also accepts an AtomSelectorConfig object. This object has a required `selector` field and optional `argsComparator` and `resultsComparator` fields.

- `selector` - The AtomSelector whose args and result we're configuring.

- `argsComparator` - A function that accepts two parameters - the new args and old args - and should return a boolean. This function is called during component render (when used in `useAtomSelector`) or atom evaluation (when used in `injectAtomSelector` or Ion/AtomGetter `select` calls). This function is not called on the first render/evaluation. On subsequent renders/evaluations, if this function returns true, Zedux will not run the AtomSelector again. The selector will still run when its own dependencies update. Such runs will use the args from the previous run. If no `argsComparator` is set, Zedux will still prevent the AtomSelector from running if all args reference-match the previous args and the selector function reference is the same.

- `resultsComparator` - A function that accepts two parameters - the new result and old result - and should return a boolean. If this function returns true, Zedux will not trigger a component rerender (when used in `useAtomSelector`) or an atom reevaluation (when used in `injectAtomSelector` or Ion/AtomGetter `select` calls). This function is not called on the first run. After that, it's called during render/evaluation after the selector runs due to args changing (according to the `argsComparator` logic described above). It will also run after the selector runs due to any of its own dependencies updating.

:::note
AtomSelectorConfig options (other than `selector`) are ignored when passed to `ecosystem.select()` and nested `select()` calls. They're accepted overloads simply for interop convenience.
