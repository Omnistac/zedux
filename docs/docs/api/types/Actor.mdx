The function returned from [the `createActor()` factory](../factories/createActor).

An "actor" is just a fancy "action creator" function that has a `.type` property.

## Definition

```ts
type Actor = { type: string } & (payload?) => Action
```

Returns an [action object](Action) for [dispatching](../classes/Store#dispatch) to [stores](../classes/Store).

### `payload`

Optional. For TS users, it will be required if a Payload generic was passed to `createActor`.

This will be set as the `payload` property of the returned action object.

## Example

```ts
import { createActor } from '@zedux/react'

createActor('test')('payload') // { type: 'test', payload: 'payload' }

interface Todo {
  text: string
}

const addTodo = createActor<Todo>('todos/add')

store.dispatch(addTodo({ text: 'be awesome' }))
```

You could manually create an actor:

```ts
const addTodo = payload => ({
  type: addTodo.type,
  payload
})

addTodo.type = 'addTodo'
```

But just why.
