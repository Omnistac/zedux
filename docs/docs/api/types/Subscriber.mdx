import { LiveEditor } from '../../LiveEditor'

A function passed to [`store.subscribe()`](../classes/Store#subscribe). Zedux will call the function when certain events happen.

## Subscriber Types

There are 3 types of subscribers:

- normal (or "next") - will be called on state change.
- error - will be called whenever a dispatch or setState call throws an error.
- effects - will be called every time an action is dispatched to the store, regardless of whether the action triggered a state update.

Passing a function to `store.subscribe()` registers a normal subscriber. To register error and effect subscribers, pass an object with optional `next`, `error`, and `effects` properties.

### Normal

```ts
store.subscribe((newState, oldState, action) => {
  console.log('state changed', { newState, oldState, action })
})

// or
store.subscribe({
  next: (newState, oldState, action) => ...
})
```

Also called "next" subscribers. These subscribers receive 3 parameters:

```ts
type NextSubscriber<State = any> = (
  newState: State,
  prevState: State | undefined,
  action: ActionChain
) => void
```

#### `newState`

The current state of the store, after the latest operation changed it.

#### `oldState`

The state of the store before the latest operation changed it. Can be `undefined` if the subscriber is registered before the store's state is set.

#### `action`

The action that triggered the state change. If the state change was due to a `setState` call or an action dispatched in a parent or child store, this action will be an [ActionChain](ActionChain) containing metadata that can be used to reproduce the state update from this store for time travel.

### Error

```ts
store.subscribe({
  error: err => {
    console.error('Store update raised an error', err)
  },
})
```

Will be called if an error is thrown in any reducer or in a function passed to `.setState()`

```ts
store.setState(currentState => {
  throw 'test-error'
})
```

Error subscribers receive a single parameter:

```ts
type ErrorSubscriber = (error: Error) => void
```

#### `error`

The error that was thrown.

### Effects

```ts
store.subscribe({
  effects: ({ action, error, newState, oldState, store }) => {},
})
```

Effects subscribers will be called every time an action is dispatched to the store - regardless of whether that action causes a state change, raises an error, or has no effect.

They are also called for [pseudo-actions](../glossary#pseudo-action) (e.g. actions generated from `setState()` calls) that trigger state updates or raise errors.

Effects subscribers are not called when a `setState()` call doesn't change the state.

```ts
store.dispatch({ type: 'anything' }) // hits effects subscribers
parentStore.dispatch({ type: 'anything' }) // hits store's effects subscribers
childStore.dispatch({ type: 'anything' }) // hits store's effects subscribers
store.setState(state => !state) // hits effects subscribers
store.setState(state => state) // doesn't hit effects subscribers
```

Effects subscribers receive an object with the following properties:

```ts
interface EffectData<State = any> {
  action?: ActionChain
  error?: Error
  newState: State
  oldState?: State
  store: Store<State>
}

type EffectsSubscriber<State = any> = (effectData: EffectData<State>) => void
```

#### `action`

The action or pseudo-action that triggered the effect. If the state change was due to a `setState` call or an action dispatched in a parent or child store, this action will be an [ActionChain](ActionChain) containing metadata that can be used to reproduce the state update from this store for time travel.

#### `error`

The error that was thrown, if any.

#### `newState`

The current state of the store, after passing the action through the reducer layer or applying any state updates from a `setState()` call.

#### `oldState`

The previous state of the store, before the action was dispatched. Can be `undefined` if the subscriber is registered before the store's state is set.

#### `store`

A reference to the store this effects subscriber is subscribed to.

## Example

<LiveEditor resultVar="Subscribers">{`
const store = createStore(null, 1)\n
function Subscribers() {
  const [log, setLog] = useState('')\n
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = store.subscribe({
      next: (newState, oldState, action) => setLog(
        log => \`\${log}Next - \${JSON.stringify({
          newState,
          oldState,
          action
        })}\\n\\n\`
      ),
      error: (...params) => setLog(
        log => \`\${log}Error - \${params}\\n\\n\`
      ),
      effects: (...params) => setLog(
        log => \`\${log}Effect - \${JSON.stringify(params)}\\n\\n\`
      )
    })\n
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  }, [])\n
  return (
    <>
      <pre>{log}</pre>
      <button onClick={() => store.setState(1)}>Set to 1</button>
      <button onClick={() => store.setState(2)}>Set to 2</button>
      <button onClick={() => store.dispatch({ type: 'test' })}>
        Dispatch Action
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        try {
          store.setState(() => {
            throw new Error('test-error')
          })
        } catch (err) {}
      }}>
        Trigger Error
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
`}</LiveEditor>

## Definition

```ts
type Subscriber<State = any> = NextSubscriber<State> | SubscriberObject<State>

interface SubscriberObject<State = any> {
  next?: NextSubscriber<State>
