import { Legend, Item, Link, Tabs, Ts, tab1, tab2 } from '@site/src/all'

An object that provides several functions for working with atoms.

```ts
{
  ecosystem, get, getInstance, select
}
```

You'll find this object in the following places:

- The first parameter to [ion state factories](../factories/ion#statefactory).
- The first parameter to [AtomSelectors](AtomSelector).
- [`injectAtomGetters()`](../injectors/injectAtomGetters) returns one.
- [Ecosystems](../classes/Ecosystem) themselves are AtomGetters objects, minus the `ecosystem` property.

When called synchronously during atom or selector evaluation, `get`, `getInstance`, and `select` will register graph dependencies on resolved [atom instances](../classes/AtomInstance) and [SelectorCaches](../classes/SelectorCache). Thus:

- `get()` is similar to [`injectAtomValue()`](../injectors/injectAtomValue).
- `getInstance()` is similar to [`injectAtomInstance()`](../injectors/injectAtomInstance).
- `select()` is similar to [`injectAtomSelector()`](../injectors/injectAtomSelector).

The ecosystem's AtomGetters (`ecosystem.get()`, `ecosystem.getInstance()`, and `ecosystem.select()`) however **never** register graph dependencies.

The AtomGetters are **not** injectors. This means they can be called in loops or if statements or even asynchronously.

When called asynchronously, AtomGetters don't register graph dependencies; they simply return the expected values. Thus:

- `get` becomes an alias for [`ecosystem.get()`](../classes/Ecosystem#get).
- `getInstance` becomes an alias for [`ecosystem.getInstance()`](../classes/Ecosystem#getinstance).
- `select` becomes an alias for [`ecosystem.select()`](../classes/Ecosystem#select).

    <p>
      The ecosystem is called an "AtomGetter", but it's really an AtomGetter
      object containing its own AtomGetters. Ecosystems are the only AtomGetters
      objects that don't have an <code>ecosystem</code> property (they don't
      need it obviously).
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this AtomGetter when you want to specifically avoid registering graph
      dependencies.
    </p>
    <Ts>{`const dynamicVal = get(val) // registers a dependency
const staticVal = ecosystem.get(val) // doesn't register anything`}</Ts>
    <p>The ecosystem also has additional methods for getting atom instances:</p>
    <Ts>{`// returns the first matching atom instance only if one exists already
// (unlike ecosystem.getInstance() which creates the instance if it doesn't exist):
ecosystem.find(myAtom, [param1, param2])\n
// returns all matching atom instances. Also doesn't create any instances:
ecosystem.findAll(myAtom, [param1, param2])`}</Ts>
    <p>
      Both{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#find">
        <code>ecosystem.find()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      and{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#findall">
        <code>ecosystem.findAll()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      can take a fuzzy search string to find instances whose ids contain the
      passed string (case-insensitive).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ecosystem, you also have access to the{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#selectorcache">
        <code>.selectors</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      property for full manual control over cached selectors.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="get">
    <p>
      A function that returns the current state of an atom instance's store.
      Pass either an atom template and its params (if the atom takes params) or
      an atom instance directly.
    </p>
    <Ts>{`value = get(myAtom)
value = get(myAtom, [param1, param2])
value = get(myAtomInstance)`}</Ts>
    <p>
      When an atom template is passed, <code>get()</code> creates the instance
      if it doesn't exist yet, registers a dynamic graph dependency on the
      instance, and returns its initial value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an instance is passed, <code>get()</code> registers a dynamic graph
      dependency on that instance and returns its current value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When called asynchronously (after the current atom instance or selector
      finishes evaluating), <code>get()</code> doesn't register any graph
      dependencies. Other than that, it behaves the same as when called
      synchronously during evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#find">
        <code>ecosystem.find().getState()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      to get a value only if the instance already exists. Note however that the
      ecosystem's getters don't register graph dependencies. To weakly register
      a dependency, use the following pattern:
    </p>
    <Ts>{`const instance = ecosystem.find(myAtom, [param1, param2])
const val = instance ? get(instance) : defaultVal`}</Ts>
  </Item>
  <Item name="getInstance">
    <p>
      A function that returns the atom instance for the given atom template +
      params combo. Pass either an atom template and its params (if the atom
      takes params) or an atom instance directly.
    </p>
    <Ts>{`instance = getInstance(myAtom)
instance = getInstance(myAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'])
instance = getInstance(myAtomInstance)`}</Ts>
    <p>
      When an atom template is passed, <code>getInstance()</code> creates the
      instance if it doesn't exist yet, registers a static graph dependency on
      the instance, and returns it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an instance is passed, <code>getInstance()</code> registers a static
      graph dependency on that instance and returns it as-is.
    </p>
    <p>
      When called asynchronously (after the current atom instance or selector
      finishes evaluating), <code>getInstance()</code> doesn't register any
      graph dependencies. Other than that, it behaves the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#find">
        <code>ecosystem.find()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      to get an instance only if it already exists. Note however that the
      ecosystem's getters don't register graph dependencies. To weakly register
      a static dependency, use the following pattern:
    </p>
    <Ts>{`const maybeInstance = ecosystem.find(myAtom, [param1, param2])
const instance = maybeInstance ? getInstance(maybeInstance) : undefined`}</Ts>
  </Item>
  <Item name="select">
    <p>
      A function that returns an <Link to="AtomSelector">atom selector's</Link>{' '}
      value. Pass an atom selector, an{' '}
      <Link to="AtomSelectorConfig">AtomSelectorConfig</Link> object, or a{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/SelectorCache">SelectorCache</Link> instance.
    </p>
    <Ts>{`value = select(atomSelector, arg1, arg2)
value = select(atomSelectorConfig, arg1, arg2)
value = select(aSelectorCache)`}</Ts>
    <p>
      If an atom selector or AtomSelectorConfig object is passed and the
      selector takes arguments, those are required. Note that unlike{' '}
      <code>get()</code> and <code>getInstance()</code>, <code>select</code>'s
      args are spread into the function call, instead of being passed as an
      array.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an atom selector or AtomSelectorConfig object is passed,{' '}
      <code>select()</code> runs and caches the atom selector if it hasn't been
      cached yet and returns the result. This is unlike{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#select">ecosystem.select()</Link> which
      never caches the selector (though it will return the cached value if one
      exists).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a SelectorCache is passed, <code>select()</code> registers a dynamic
      dependency on the cache and returns the cache's current result.
    </p>
    <p>
      When called asynchronously (after the current atom instance or selector
      finishes evaluating), <code>select()</code> doesn't register any graph
      dependencies. Other than that, it behaves the same as when called
      synchronously during evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Selectors#find">
        <code>ecosystem.selectors.find(mySelector)?.result</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      to get the selector's cached value only if it has been cached already.
      Note however that this doesn't register any graph dependencies. To weakly
      register a dynamic dependency on a selector, use the following pattern:
    </p>
    <Ts>{`const cache = ecosystem.selectors.find(mySelector)
const val = cache ? select(cache) : defaultVal`}</Ts>
    <p>
      For best cache performance, pass a stable atom selector function (or
      AtomSelectorConfig object) reference. Inline selectors work too, but will
      make Zedux do extra work on reevaluations when the selector reference
      changes. This is usually fine, but be mindful of it in larger apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stable references can also make your graph look better, since Zedux
      defaults to using the selector function's name as part of its{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/SelectorCache#id">
        <code>id</code>
      </Link>
      . Unless you specifically make your inline selectors named functions (not common),
      they won't have a name, causing Zedux to generate a random id.
