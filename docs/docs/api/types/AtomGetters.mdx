The object Zedux passes as the first parameter to [ion getters](../factories/ion#get) and [AtomSelectors](AtomSelector).

## Definition

```ts
interface AtomGetters {
  ecosystem: Ecosystem

  get<A extends Atom<any, []>>(atom: A): AtomStateType<A>

  get<A extends Atom<any, [...any]>>(
    atom: A,
    params: AtomParamsType<A>
  ): AtomStateType<A>

  get<I extends AtomInstance>(instance: I): AtomInstanceStateType<I>

  getInstance<A extends Atom<any, []>>(atom: A): AtomInstanceType<A>

  getInstance<A extends Atom<any, any, any>>(
    atom: A,
    params: AtomParamsType<A>
  ): AtomInstanceType<A>

  getInstance<I extends AtomInstance>(instance: I): I

  select<T, Args extends any[]>(
    atomSelector: AtomSelectorOrConfig<T, Args>,
    ...args: Args
  ): T

  select<A extends AtomBase<any, [], any>, D>(
    atom: A,
    selector: Selector<AtomStateType<A>, D>
  ): D

  select<A extends AtomBase<any, [...any], any>, D>(
    atom: A,
    params: AtomParamsType<A>
  ): D

  select<AI extends AtomInstanceBase<any, [], any>, D>(instance: AI): D
}
```

### `ecosystem`

A reference to the [ecosystem](../classes/Ecosystem) this ion instance was created in.

### `get`

A function that returns the current state of an atom instance. You can pass either an instance directly or an atom and its params (if any).

```ts
get(otherAtom)
get(otherAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'])
get(anInstance)
```

When called synchronously during instance evaluation, `get` registers a [dynamic graph dependency](../glossary#dynamic-graph-dependency) on the resolved atom instance.

When called asynchronously (e.g. in an [`injectEffect`](../injectors/injectEffect)), `get` does not register a dependency; it simply returns the resolved atom instance's value.

### `getInstance`

A function that returns an atom instance. Pass an atom and its params (if any)

```ts
getInstance(otherAtom)
getInstance(otherAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'])
getInstance(anInstance)
```

When called synchronously during instance evaluation, `getInstance` registers a [static graph dependency](../glossary#static-graph-dependency) on the resolved atom instance.

When called asynchronously (e.g. in an `injectEffect`), `getInstance` does not register a dependency; it simply returns the resolved atom instance.

### `select`

A function that returns a derivation of an atom instance's state.

```ts
select(atomSelector)
select(anAtom, selectorFn)
select(anAtom, ['param 1', 'param 2'], selectorFn)
select(anInstance, selectorFn)
```

When called synchronously during instance evaluation, `select` registers [restricted dynamic graph dependencies](../glossary/#restricted-dynamic-graph-dependency) on any atom instances it uses.

If an [AtomSelector](AtomSelector) is passed, `select` will register static dependencies for every `getInstance`, dynamic dependencies for every `get`, and restricted dynamic dependencies for every `select` that it calls (this is recursive!) synchronously.

If an atom or atom instance is passed, the selector will register a single restricted dynamic dependency on the resolved atom instance - with updates "restricted" to only happening when the passed `selectorFn`'s result changes.

When called asynchronously (e.g. in an `injectEffect`), `select` does not register any dependencies; it simply returns the selected value.
