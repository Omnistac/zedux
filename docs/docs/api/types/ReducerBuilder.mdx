The function returned from [createReducer](../factories/createReducer).

A ReducerBuilder _is_ a [reducer](Reducer) - it can be used directly as a reducer passed to [`createStore()`](../factories/createStore) or React's `useReducer()` hook.

ReducerBuilders also have a `.reduce()` method that can be used to extend the reducer's capabilities.

## Examples

```ts
import { createReducer } from '@zedux/react'

const builder = createReducer('initial state')

builder.reduce('myActionType', (state, payload) => )
```

## Definition

```ts
type SubReducer<
  State = any,
  Payload = any,
  Type extends string = string,
  Meta = any
> = (
  state: State,
  payload: Payload,
  action: Action<Payload, Type, Meta>
) => State

interface ReducerBuilder<State = any> extends Reducer<State> {
  reduce<Payload = any, Type extends string = any, Meta = any>(
    reactable: Reactable<Payload, Type> | Reactable<Payload, Type>[],
    subReducer: SubReducer<State, Payload, Type, Meta>
  ): ReducerBuilder<State>
}
```

<Legend>
  <Item name="reduce">
    <p>
      A function that accepts an action type and a "sub-reducer" and returns the
      ReducerBuilder for chaining.
    </p>
    <p>The action type can be any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A string.</li>
      <li>
        An <Link to="ActionFactory">ActionFactory</Link> with <code>.type</code>{' '}
        property attached.
      </li>
      <li>A list containing any combination of the above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The sub-reducer is a function that accepts the current state, the payload
      from the matched action, and the full action object, and should return the
      new state or the current state if no change.
    </p>
    <Ts>{`.reduce([myActionFactory, 'myActionType'], (state, payload, action) => newState)`}</Ts>
  </Item>
</Legend>
