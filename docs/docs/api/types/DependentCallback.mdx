import { Legend, Item, Link, Tabs, Ts, tab1, tab2 } from '@site/src/all'

A low-level function used when manually graphing e.g. with [`ecosystem.selectors.addDependent()`](../classes/Selectors#adddependent) or [`atomInstance.addDependent()`](../classes/AtomInstance#adddependent). This function is called with special "GraphEdgeSignals" when Zedux needs to push some new information about the dependency to the dependent.

## Example

```ts
const exampleAtom = atom('example', () => 'test')
let instance = ecosystem.getInstance(exampleAtom)

// keep the local `instance` reference up-to-date in case of force destruction:
const cleanup = instance.addDependent({
  callback: (signal, val, reason) => {
    if (signal === 'Destroyed') {
      instance = ecosystem.getInstance(exampleAtom)
    }
  },
})
```

## Definition

```ts
type DependentCallback = (
  signal: GraphEdgeSignal,
  val?: any,
  reason?: EvaluationReason
) => void
```

{<Legend>
  <Item name="signal">
    <p>A string. One of:</p>
    <Ts>{`'Destroyed' | 'Updated'`}</Ts>
    <p>
      A dependent can only receive the "Destroyed" signal when the dependency is
      force-destroyed, since this dependent would prevent destruction otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Updated" signal can mean either the dependency's state changed or its
      promise reference changed.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="val">
    <p>
      The current state of the dependency. If the dependency is an atom
      instance, this is the current state of the atom instance's store. If the
      dependency is an atom selector, this is the current <code>.result</code>{' '}
      property of the atom selector's cache item.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="reason">
    <p>
      The single <Link to="EvaluationReason">EvaluationReason</Link> that
      triggered this signal. Note that if multiple updates were batched, only
      the first reason will be passed here - this callback will never receive
      the others.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}
