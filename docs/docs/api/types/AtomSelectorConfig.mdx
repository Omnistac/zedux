Everywhere Zedux accepts an AtomSelector, it also accepts an AtomSelectorConfig object. This object has a required `selector` field and a few optional fields used to configure the selector.

It is recommended to set the `name` field for optimal debugging when viewing the atom graph since Zedux can't derive a useful name from AtomSelectorConfig objects like it can with named AtomSelector functions. You can also make the `selector` field a named function instead of using an anonymous function.

## Examples

```tsx live ecosystemId=AtomSelector/example resultVar=CountBy5
const counterAtom = atom('counter', 0)

function CountBy5() {
  const { setState } = useAtomInstance(counterAtom)
  const counter = useAtomSelector({
    name: 'getCounter',
    resultsComparator: newCount => newCount % 5,
    selector: ({ get }) => get(counterAtom),
  })

  return (
    <>
      <div>Value: {counter}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setState(state => state + 1)}>
        Increment (click me 5 times)
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

:::tip
AtomSelectors sometimes have config that's inherent to how they operate. Rather than exporting the selector function and requiring consumers to specify the config, export the config object itself (tightly coupling the selector to its mandatory config):
:::

```ts
// instead of:
export const getUserSnapshot = ({ get }: AtomGetters) => get(currentUserAtom)
...
select({
  resultsComparator: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
  selector: getUserSnapshot,
})

// do:
export const getUserSnapshot = {
  name: 'getUserSnapshot', // recommended if using an anonymous function
  resultsComparator: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
  selector: ({ get }) => get(currentUserAtom)
}
...
select(getUserSnapshot)
```

Miscellaneous:

```ts
// Inline:
useAtomSelector({
  argsComparator: (newVal, oldVal) => Math.abs(newVal - oldVal) > 5,
  name: 'timesTwo',
  selector: ({ get }: AtomGetters) => get(myAtom) * 2,
})

// Extracted:
const timesTwo = {
  argsComparator: (newVal, oldVal) => Math.abs(newVal - oldVal) > 5,
  name: 'timesTwo',
  selector: ({ get }) => get(myAtom) * 2,
}
useAtomSelector(timesTwo)

// With arguments:
const timesTwoPlusWhatever = {
  argsComparator: (newVal, oldVal) => Math.abs(newVal - oldVal) > 5,
  name: 'timesTwo',
  selector: ({ get }, whatever: number) => get(myAtom) * 2 + whatever,
}
useAtomSelector(timesTwoPlusWhatever, 3)
```

      . It is ignored in all other AtomSelector-related APIs. This is because selectors
      are given completely different cache entries when different args are passed.

      because of this limitation, this config option is rarely useful.

      Return true if <code>useAtomSelector()</code> should consider both lists
      the "same", preventing the selector from reevaluating. Return false to
      force the selector to reevaluate.

      This function is only called after the selector has already run once

      Zedux uses this name to create the node's key in the graph. For your
