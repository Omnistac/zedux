An AtomConfig object is the 3rd argument passed to [the `atom()` factory](../factories/atom).

## Definition

```ts
interface AtomConfig {
  dehydrate?: <D>(state: State) => D
  flags?: string[]
  hydrate?: <D>(dehydratedState: D) => State
  manualHydration?: boolean
  ttl?: number
}
```

All fields are optional.

{<Legend>
  <Item name="dehydrate">
    <p>
      A function that accepts the current state of an instance of this atom and
      transforms it into a serializable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <code>dehydrate</code> doesn't have to return a string. Any
      serializable value will do, including JS objects and arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function is called by Zedux whenever{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#dehydrate">
        <code>ecosystem.dehydrate()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      is called without <code>{`{ transform: false }`}</code>. It's called once
      for every instance of this atom that is to be included in the dehydration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary use of <code>dehydrate</code> is to transform a
      non-serializable JS value into a serializable representation of it. For
      example when working with JS maps, sets, or similar data types from
      3rd-party libraries, you can use <code>dehydrate</code> to improve logging
      or enable SSR.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will usually pair this with{' '}
      <Link to="#hydrate">
        <code>hydrate</code>
      </Link>
      .
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="flags">
    <p>
      An array of strings. These flags correlate to the{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#flags">
        ecosystem's <code>flags</code> property
      </Link>
      . See that page for an example.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="hydrate">
    <p>
      A function that accepts a serializable version of an atom instance's value
      and transforms it into the proper data type expected by instances of this
      atom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The received value will usually be whatever was previously returned from a{' '}
      <Link to="#dehydrate">
        <code>dehydrate</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function is called by Zedux whenever an atom instance of this atom is
      hydrated after a corresponding hydration has been set in the ecosystem via{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Ecosystem#hydrate">
        <code>ecosystem.hydrate()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      . It's called once for every instance of this atom that is to be hydrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will probably always pair this with{' '}
      <Link to="#dehydrate">
        <code>dehydrate</code>
      </Link>
      .
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="manualHydration">
    <p>
      A boolean. If set to <code>true</code>, this prevents Zedux from
      automatically hydrating instances of this atom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default hydration flow can often make atom instances evaluate twice
      unnecessarily. Use this combined with <code>injectStore()</code>'s <code>{`{ hydrate: true }`}</code>{' '}
      option to hydrate the atom instance properly on initial evaluation,
      preventing the double-evaluation.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="ttl">
    A number. How long instances of the atom should stick around when stale. See{' '}
    <Link to="../classes/AtomTemplate#ttl">AtomTemplate#ttl</Link>.
  </Item>
</Legend>}
