The function returned from [the `actionFactory()` factory](../factories/actionFactory).

An action factory is just a function that has a `.type` property and returns [action objects](Action) with that type.

## Example

```ts
import { actionFactory } from '@zedux/react'

actionFactory('test')('payload') // { type: 'test', payload: 'payload' }

interface Todo {
  text: string
}

const addTodo = actionFactory<Todo>('todos/add')

store.dispatch(addTodo({ text: 'be awesome' }))
```

You can also manually create an action factory:

```ts
const addTodo = payload => ({
  type: addTodo.type,
  payload,
})

addTodo.type = 'addTodo'
```

## Definition

```ts
type ActionFactory = {
  (payload?) => Action
  type: string
}
```

Returns an [action object](Action) ready to be [dispatched](../classes/Store#dispatch) to a [store](../classes/Store).

Passing the payload is required if a Payload generic was passed to `actionFactory` (this is obviously only enforced for TS users). This will be set as the `payload` property of the returned action object.
