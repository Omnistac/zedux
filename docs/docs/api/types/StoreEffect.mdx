import { Legend, Item, Link, Tabs, Ts, tab1, tab2 } from '@site/src/all'

An object that describes a state change in a [store](../classes/Store). Zedux creates one of these every time a store's state changes. This is the object passed to [effects subscribers](Subscriber#effects) and [state machine listeners](../../packages/machines/MachineState#onenter) (on machines in the `@zedux/machines` package).

## Definition

```ts
interface StoreEffect<State = any, S extends Store<State> = Store<State>> {
  action: ActionChain
  error?: unknown
  newState: State
  oldState?: State
  store: S
}
```

{<Legend>
  <Item name="action">
    <p>
      A reference to the <Link to="Action">action</Link> (or{' '}
      <Link to="ActionChain">ActionChain</Link>) object that triggered the state
      change or that caused the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every state update in Zedux is triggered by an action. Even{' '}
      <Link to="../classes/Store#setstate">
        <code>store.setState()</code>
      </Link>{' '}
      and similar APIs always generate "psuedo actions" representing the change.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="error">
    <p>
      If the dispatch call errored, this will be a reference to the error that
      was thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This only applies to errors thrown in reducers due to a call to{' '}
      <code>store.dispatch()</code>. If a function passed to{' '}
      <code>store.setState()</code> and similar methods throws an error, that
      error will be thrown back to the caller and subscribers won't be notified.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="newState">
    <p>
      The store's new state after passing the action through this store's
      reducer layer and to all child stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effects subscribers run after the state has been completely updated, so
      this value will be exactly equal to <code>store.getState()</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="oldState">
    <p>
      The state of the store before this action changed it. Can be undefined if
      this is the first time this store's state has ever been set.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="store">
    <p>
      A reference to the store itself. Useful when external or general-purpose
      effects subscribers are registered without having a reference to the store
      they were registered in.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}
