title: EcosystemConfig
---

The config object passed to [the `createEcosystem()` factory](../factories/createEcosystem).

## Definition

```ts
interface EcosystemConfig<Context extends Record<string, any> = any> {
  context?: Context
  destroyOnUnmount?: boolean
  flags?: string[]
  id?: string
  overrides?: Atom[]
  onReady?: (ecosystem: Ecosystem, prevContext?: Context) => void
}
```

All fields are optional. It is recommended to at least pass an id.

### `context`

An object. The initial [context](../classes/Ecosystem#context) for the ecosystem.

### `destroyOnUnmount`

A boolean. Whether the ecosystem should destroy itself when its last [`<EcosystemProvider>`](../components/EcosystemProvider) unmounts. Useful for testing.

### `flags`

An array of strings. Will be set as the [ecosystem's flags](../classes/Ecosystem#flags).

### `id`

A string. Identifies the ecosystem in the [zeduxGlobalStore](../constants/zeduxGlobalStore) and in dev tools.

### `onReady`

A function. Will be called as soon as the ecosystem has initialized. Can be used to bootstrap data and preload atoms.

Signature:

```ts
(ecosystem, prevContext?) => void
```

Receives the freshly initialized or reset ecosystem. On [reset](../classes/Ecosystem#reset) also receives the previous context object as the second parameter.

### `overrides`

An array of [atoms](../classes/Atom). Will be set as the [ecosystem's overrides](../classes/Ecosystem#overrides). Used for [Dependency Injection](../../walkthrough/dependency-injection).
