Every update that causes an atom instance to reevaluate produces an EvaluationReason. You can get the list of reasons that caused an atom instance to reevaluate using [`injectWhy()`](../injectors/injectWhy). To get the reason list for selectors, use [`ecosystem.why()`](../classes/Ecosystem#why).

## Definition

```ts
interface EvaluationReason<State = any> {
  action?: ActionChain
  newState?: State
  oldState?: State
  operation: string // e.g. a function like "injectAtomValue"
  sourceType: EvaluationSourceType
  sourceId?: string // e.g. an instance id like "todos" or "userData-[1]"
  reasons?: EvaluationReason[]
  type: EvaluationType
}

type EvaluationSourceType =
  | 'Atom'
  | 'AtomSelector'
  | 'External'
  | 'Injector'
  | 'Store'

type EvaluationType =
  | 'cache invalidated'
  | 'node destroyed'
  | 'promise changed'
  | 'state changed'
```

{<Legend>
  <Item name="action">
    <p>
      If this EvaluationReason was a store's state updating, then this will be a
      reference to the <Link to="ActionChain">ActionChain object</Link> that
      caused the update. Otherwise, will be undefined.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="newState">
    <p>
      The source's new state after updating. If the source is a store, this is
      the new state of the store. If the source is an atom instance, it's the
      new state of the atom instance's store. If the source is external (e.g. an
      invalidation from a React component), this will be undefined.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="oldState">
    <p>
      The source's state before updating. If the source is a store, this is the
      previous state of the store. If the source is an atom instance, it's the
      old state of the atom instance's store. If the source is external, this
      will be undefined.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="operation">
    <p>
      The name of the function triggering this evaluation. If the source is an
      atom, injector, or store, <code>operation</code> will be the function name
      you called to create the{' '}
      <Link to="../glossary#dynamic-graph-dependency">
        dynamic graph dependency
      </Link>{' '}
      - e.g. an injector name like "injectStore" or "injectAtomValue". If the
      source is external, the operation name will be "invalidate".
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="sourceId">
    <p>
      If the source dependency was another atom instance or selector, this will
      be that instance's or selector's id. Otherwise, this will be undefined.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="sourceType">
    <p>
      What type of thing changed. Could be a store subscribed to via{' '}
      <Link to="../injectors/injectStore">
        <code>injectStore()</code>
      </Link>
      , an injected atom instance, or an <Link to="../classes/AtomInstance#invalidate">
        <code>.invalidate()</code>
      </Link> call from a dependent.
    </p>
    <p>See the "EvaluationSourceType" definition above.</p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="reasons">
    <p>
      An array of EvaluationReasons. If the source dependency itself was updated
      in response to one of its dependencies updating, those EvaluationReasons
      will be listed here.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is recursive! With this, you can see an update that originated many
      layers deep in the dependency tree and ultimately led to this atom
      reevaluating. If the source dependency was the instigator of the change,
      then this will be undefined.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="type">
    <p>
      The type of update that occurred. Could be a store's state changing, an
      atom instance being destroyed, an atom instance's promise changing, or an
      invalidation triggered externally.
    </p>
    <p>See the "EvaluationType" definition above.</p>
