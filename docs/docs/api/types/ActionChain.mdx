The object accepted by [`store.dispatch()`](../classes/Store#dispatch), thus also the object passed to [`instance.dispatch()`](../classes/AtomInstance#dispatch).

The ActionChain is the key to Zedux's [store composition model](../../advanced/store-composition). ActionChains are just nested objects.

All objects except the innermost contain metadata. Zedux uses certain meta types to know whether actions came from a parent or child store.

The last node in the chain is a normal [Action object](Action). An ActionChain that doesn't contain any metadata is thus simply an Action.

That's right. An action _is_ an ActionChain with a size of 1.

:::info important
ActionChains are **not** sent to [reducers](Reducer). Zedux unwraps the ActionChain before passing the unwrapped action to the reducer layer.

## Definition

```ts
interface ActionMeta<Payload = any, Type extends string = string, Data = any> {
  metaType: string
  metaData?: Data
  payload: ActionChain<Payload, Type>
}

type ActionChain<Payload = any, Type extends string = string> =
  | ActionMeta<Payload, Type>
  | Action<Payload, Type>
```

## ActionMeta

You should never be creating ActionMeta objects yourself, but FYI: ActionMeta objects contain the following fields:

{<Legend>
  <Item name="metaType">
    <p>A string. The type of metadata being added to the action.</p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="metaData">
    <p>
      Can be anything, including undefined. The value depends on the{' '}
      <code>metaType</code>. For example, Zedux will set this to an array of
      strings representing a path to a child store when it wants delegate this
      action to that child store.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="payload">
    <p>
      Either another ActionMeta node or the wrapped action object if this is the
      last ActionMeta node in the chain.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}

## Examples

```ts
const justAnAction: ActionChain = {
  type: 'todos/add',
  payload: { text: 'be awesome' },
}

const fromParent: ActionChain = {
  metaType: '@@zedux/inherit',
  payload: {
    type: 'todos/add',
    payload: { text: 'be awesome' },
  },
}

const fromChild: ActionChain = {
  metaType: '@@zedux/delegate',
  metaData: ['a', 'b'],
  payload: {
    type: 'todos/add',
    payload: { text: 'be awesome' },
  },
}
```
