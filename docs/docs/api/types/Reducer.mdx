In Zedux, reducers are exactly the same as in Redux and React. A reducer is just a function that receives the current state and an [action](Action) and returns the new state.

[Stores](../classes/Store) can be configured with reducers by passing a reducer to [`createStore()`](../factories/createStore) or [`store.use()`](../classes/Store#use).

## Example

```ts
import { createStore } from '@zedux/react'

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return state + 1
  }

  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return state - 1
  }

  return state
}

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.getState() // 0
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'decrement' }) // 1
```

## Creation

While you can create reducers manually like we just did, Zedux exports a high-level [`createReducer()`](../factories/createReducer) factory for creating them easily:

```ts
import { createReducer, createStore } from '@zedux/react'

const counterReducer = createReducer(0) // the initial state
  .reduce('increment', state => state + 1)
  .reduce('decrement', state => state - 1)

const store = createStore(counterReducer)

store.getState() // 0
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) // 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'decrement' }) // 1
```

## Definition

```ts
type Reducer<State = any> = (state: State | undefined, action: Action) => State
```

{<Legend>
  <Item name="state">
    <p>
      The current state of this reducer or <code>undefined</code> if this is the
      first time the reducer is run. Note that reducers should never return
      undefined.
    </p>
    <p>Common practice is to assign this parameter to a default value.</p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="action">
    An <Link to="Action">Action</Link> object. Note that this will never be an{' '}
    <Link to="ActionChain">ActionChain</Link> object - Zedux unwraps all meta
    nodes before passing actions to the reducer layer.
  </Item>
  <Item name="Returns">
    The new state or, if the action did not cause a change, the existing state.
    Don't return undefined from reducers. To return an "empty" value, use{' '}
    <code>null</code>.
  </Item>
</Legend>}
