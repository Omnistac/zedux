import { Legend, Item, Link, Tabs, Ts, tab1, tab2 } from '@site/src/all'

A utility function that Zedux uses internally to identify class instances.

Zedux uses this instead of `instanceof`. Zedux can't use JavaScript's `instanceof` because Zedux is designed to work across windows, with other instances of itself. `instanceof` can't recognize classes that are instances of a different class reference, even if they're the same "class" in Zedux's eyes.

`is()` works by checking if a value's `.$$typeof` property matches a static property with the same name on the given class. These `$$typeof` properties are JavaScript Symbols, which are properly shared across windows.

## Example

```ts
import { createStore, is, Store } from '@zedux/react'

const store = createStore()
is(store, Store) // true

class MyCustomStore extends Store {}

const customStore = new MyCustomStore()
is(customStore, Store) // true
```

## Accepted Classes

Here's the full list of Zedux classes that can be checked with `is()`:

- [`AtomApi`](../classes/AtomApi)
- [`AtomInstance`](../classes/AtomInstance)
- [`SelectorCache`](../classes/SelectorCache)
- [`Store`](../classes/Store)

Any class that extends these classes works too.

## Definition

```ts
is = (value, classToCheck) => boolean
```

{<Legend>
  <Item name="value">
    <p>
      The value that may or may not be an instance of <code>classToCheck</code>.
      Can be anything.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="classToCheck">
    <p>
      A class that contains a public static <code>$$typeof</code> symbol.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="Returns">
    <p>
      True if <code>value</code> is an instance of <code>classToCheck</code>.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>}
