```ts
import { EcosystemProvider } from '@zedux/react'
```

A component that provides an [ecosystem](../classes/Ecosystem). The provided ecosystem will take command of all atom usages in any child components.

## Examples

Passing an ecosystem:

```tsx
import { EcosystemProvider, createEcosystem } from '@zedux/react'

const rootEcosystem = createEcosystem({ id: 'root', overrides: [someAtom] })

function App() {
  return (
    <EcosystemProvider ecosystem={rootEcosystem}>
      <Routes />
    </EcosystemProvider>
  )
}
```

Passing configuration:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <EcosystemProvider id="root" overrides={[someAtom]}>
      <Routes />
    </EcosystemProvider>
  )
}
```

Consuming the ecosystem happens automatically every time you use any Zedux hooks in any child component.

## Props

You can pass either an existing [ecosystem](../classes/Ecosystem) via the `ecosystem` prop or any number of [EcosystemConfig properties](../types/EcosystemConfig) via their respectively named props.

When passing config properties, the EcosystemProvider will create an ecosystem for you. It is recommended to at least pass an id.

### `context`

Optional. An object. The initial [context](../classes/Ecosystem#context) for the created ecosystem.

### `destroyOnUnmount`

Optional. A boolean. Default: `true`. Whether the created ecosystem should destroy itself when its last [`<EcosystemProvider>`](../components/EcosystemProvider) unmounts.

Typically you'll want this to be true when creating an ecosystem via EcosystemProvider, so that it fully cleans up after itself when unmounting.

### `ecosystem`

Optional. The ecosystem to provide. Don't pass any other props if passing this.

### `flags`

Optional. An array of strings. Will be set as the created [ecosystem's flags](../classes/Ecosystem#flags).

### `id`

Optional (recommended, if not passing `ecosystem`). A string. Identifies the created ecosystem in the [zeduxGlobalStore](../constants/zeduxGlobalStore) and in dev tools.

### `onReady`

A function. Will be called as soon as the ecosystem has initialized. Can be used to bootstrap data and preload atoms.

Signature:

```ts
(ecosystem, prevContext?) => void
```

Receives the freshly initialized or reset ecosystem. On [reset](../classes/Ecosystem#reset) also receives the previous context object as the second parameter.

### `overrides`

An array of [atoms](../classes/Atom). Will be set as the created [ecosystem's overrides](../classes/Ecosystem#overrides). Used for [Dependency Injection](../../walkthrough/dependency-injection).

If you change this prop, EcosystemProvider will call [`.setOverrides()`](../classes/Ecosystem#setoverrides) on the created ecosystem, destroying all atom instances from atoms in the previous or new overrides lists so they can be recreated.
