```ts
import { injectWhy } from '@zedux/react'
```

An [injector](../glossary#injector) that tells you why an atom instance reevaluated. This injector is ignored on the first evaluation - it returns an empty array. On subsequent evaluations, this injector returns the full list of [EvaluationReasons](../types/EvaluationReason) detailing why this atom reevaluated.

These reasons can be nested indefinitely. They can tell you abut a store state change many atoms deep in the dependency tree of this atom instance.

:::important
We will _maybe_ only make `injectWhy` usable in dev builds, as tracking evaluation reasons has some overhead. In prod, it will be a no-op that always returns an empty array.

This change is not definite. We need to actually calculate the overhead and determine if the utility `injectWhy` provides may be needed in prod.

It may also be possible to create an ecosystem option to turn on evaluation reason tracking. Feedback welcome! Open an issue and let's discuss.
:::

## Examples

Getting the list of reasons.

```tsx live ecosystemId=injectWhy/simple-example resultVar=Reasons
const reasonsAtom = atom('reasons', () => {
  const store = injectStore(0)

  injectEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => store.setState(val => val + 1), 1000)

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId)
  }, [])

  const reasons = injectWhy()

  return reasons
})

function Reasons() {
  const reasons = useAtomValue(reasonsAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <div>Last Evaluation Reasons:</div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(reasons, null, 2)}</pre>
    </>
  )
}
```

If an atom's state is set multiple times synchronously, Zedux will batch those updates. In this case, `injectWhy` can be used to get the list of intermediate state changes that ultimately resulted in this evaluation but that didn't individually cause separate evaluations.

```tsx live ecosystemId=injectWhy/batch-observing resultVar=Reasons
const reasonsAtom = atom('reasons', () => {
  const store = injectStore(0)

  const reasons = injectWhy()
  const sawFive = reasons.some(reason => reason.newState === 5)

  injectEffect(() => {
    if (sawFive) alert('hah! I saw that 5 in there!')
  }, [sawFive])

  return store
})

function Reasons() {
  const [state, setState] = useAtomState(reasonsAtom)

  return (
    <>
      <div>State: {state}</div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setState(currentState => currentState + 1)
          setState(currentState => currentState + 1)
          setState(currentState => currentState + 1)
        }}
      >
        Fire 3 Updates
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

`injectWhy` will return an empty array on the first evaluation. And that's the only time. Thus `injectWhy` can be used to determine if this is the first evaluation.

```ts
const reasons = injectWhy()
if (!reasons.length) {
  // it's the first evaluation!
}
```

## Signature

```ts
injectWhy() => EvaluationReasons
```

Returns the list of [EvaluationReasons](../types/EvaluationReason) for this reevaluation. Will return an empty array if this is the first evaluation.
