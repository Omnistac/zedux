---

A factory for creating [reducers](../types/Reducer). These reducers can then be passed to [`createStore()`](createStore) or used directly in React's `useReducer()` hooks.

## Examples

```ts
import { createActor, createReducer } from '@zedux/react'

const withInitialState = createReducer('initial state')
const withoutInitialState = createReducer()

const withStringActionTypes = createReducer([]).reduce(
  'todos/add',
  (state, newTodo) => [...state, newTodo]
)

const multipleActions = createReducer([]).reduce(
  ['todos/reset', 'todos/clear'],
  () => []
)

const addTodo = createActor<Todo>('todos/add')
const removeTodo = createActor<Todo>('todos/add')
const withActors = createReducer([])
  .reduce(addTodo, (state, newTodo) => [...state, newTodo])
  .reduce(removeTodo, (state, id) => state.filter(todo => todo.id !== id))

const clear = createActor('todos/clear')
const mixed = createReducer([])
  .reduce(addTodo, (state, newTodo) => [...state, newTodo])
  .reduce('todos/remove', (state, id) => state.filter(todo => todo.id !== id))
  .reduce(['todos/reset', clear], () => [])
```

## Signature

```ts
type SubReducer<State = any, Payload = any> = (
  state: State,
  payload: Payload
) => State

interface ZeduxReducer<State = any> extends Reducer<State> {
  reduce<Type extends string = string, Payload = any>(
    actor: Reactable<Payload, Type> | Reactable<Payload, Type>[], // TODO: allow multiple actions with different payload types
    reducer: SubReducer<State, Payload>
  ): ZeduxReducer<State>
}

createReducer<State = any>(initialState?: State) => ZeduxReducer<State>
```

A function that accepts an optional initial state and returns a ZeduxReducer object. This object is a reducer function with an attached `.reduce()` method for building out the cases this reducer handles. It can be used anywhere a reducer is required.

### `initialState`

Optional. Can be anything. The initial value of the state controlled by this reducer.

### `reduce`

A function that passes actions along to the passed SubReducer when those actions match the criteria

#### `actor`

A single action type string or actor function created with [`createActor()`](createActor) or a list of strings and/or actors. The SubReducer will be called whenever any of the actions in this list are dispatched.

#### `reducer`

A SubReducer function. SubReducers look like reducers, but instead of receiving the entire action object as the second parameter, they receive only the action's `payload` property.

```ts
.reduce(myActor, (state, actionPayload) => newState)
```
