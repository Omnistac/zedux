```ts
import { localAtom } from '@zedux/react'
```

A factory for creating [local atoms](../classes/LocalAtom).

Local atoms are just atoms that have their first param set to an optional string id. Zedux auto-generates an id every time the atom is used, if you don't pass one. Local atoms also always have their [`ttl`](../classes/Atom#ttl) set to `0`.

## Example

<LiveEditor ecosystemId="localAtom/example" resultVar="App">{`
const counterAtom = localAtom('counter', () => {
  const store = injectStore(0)\n
  return store
})\n
function App() {
  const [counter1, setCounter1] = useAtomState(counterAtom)
  const [counter2, setCounter2] = useAtomState(counterAtom)\n
  return (
    <>
      <div>First state: {counter1}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter1(state => state + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <div>Second state: {counter2}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter2(state => state + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  )
}
`}</LiveEditor>

## Signature

```ts
localAtom(key, value, config?) => LocalAtom
```

All params are the same as [the `atom()` factory](atom). Just note that the first param of a passed evaluator function should be a string. And `ttl` is set to 0 by default, instead of -1.

### `key`

Required. A string. The key should typically be unique, though there are cases (e.g. for DI) where you won't make them unique. The key identifies the atom in ecosystems where it's used.

See [`Atom#key`](../classes/Atom#key).

### `value`

Required. The value of the atom. See [the `atom()` factory](atom#value) for possible values. If an evaluator function is passed, its first parameter should be a string (doesn't have to be an optional param).

### `config`

Optional. An [AtomConfig](../types/AtomConfig) object. If it isn't passed, `ttl` will default to 0, which means the atom instance dies as soon as it has no more dependents.

```ts
atom('key', getter, { ttl: 0 })
```
