```ts
import { createActor } from '@zedux/react'
```

A factory for creating [Actors](../types/Actor).

## Example

```ts
import { createActor } from '@zedux/react'

createActor('test')('payload') // { type: 'test', payload: 'payload' }

interface Todo {
  text: string
}

const addTodo = createActor<Todo>('todos/add')

store.dispatch(addTodo({ text: 'be awesome' }))
```

## Signature

```ts
createActor<Payload>(type) => Actor
```

Typescript users will usually want to pass the `Payload` generic, which represents the type the returned actor will accept.

Returns an actor function that will return [action objects](../types/Action) with their `type` property set to the passed type.

### `type`

Required. The string `type` property of the action objects that the returned actor will create.
