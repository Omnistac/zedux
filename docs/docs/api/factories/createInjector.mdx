```ts
import { createInjector } from '@zedux/react'
```

Creates a "native" [injector](../glossary#injector). Native meaning it has all the capabilities that Zedux' built-in injectors have. Injectors created with `createInjector` will register their own "InjectorDescriptor" object in the atom instance's `._injectors` arrays wherever they're used.

## Example

```ts
const injectTemplateKey = createInjector(
  'injectTemplateKey',
  partialInstance => ({
    result: partialInstance.template.key,
    type: 'injectTemplateKey',
  })
)

const atomWithCoolKey = atom('my-very-cool-key', () => {
  const key = injectTemplateKey()
  key === 'my-very-cool-key' // true
})
```

## Partial Instance

The atom instance doesn't fully exist yet on initial evaluation. That's the purpose of the initial evaluation - to finish creating the atom instance. Because of this, you can't retrieve the full atom instance inside a state factory on initial evaluation.

However, everything but the atom's `api`, `exports`, `promise`, and `store` do exist. The ability to access these other properties (we call it a "partial instance") is the one ability that `createInjector` gives you that nothing else in Zedux does (currently).

## InjectorDescriptor

These objects are how Zedux tracks every internal injector's state and cleanup functions. Injectors you create with `createInjector` always create one of these.

Definition:

```ts
interface InjectorDescriptor {
  cleanup?: () => void
  result?: T
  type: string
}
```

<Legend>
  <Item name="cleanup">
    <p>
      Optional. A function that will be called when this atom instance is
      destroyed. Other than that, it's up to you to call this in the{' '}
      <Link to="#next">next function</Link> on reevaluations that need to
      replace the previous injector's side effects with new ones.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="result">
    <p>
      Optional. The value you want Zedux to return from the injector invocation
      on this evaluation.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="type">
    <p>
      Required. A string. This is how Zedux identifies and fetches the cached
      data for this injector on subsequent evaluations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This must be globally unique. Strings prefixed with <code>@@zedux</code>{' '}
      are reserved for use by Zedux. Good practice would be to prefix your
      injectors with a similar string.
    </p>
  </Item>
</Legend>

On top of these, you can add any fields you want. For example, injectors that take a dependency array might want to store the previous deps list on `myInjectorDescriptor.prevDeps`.

## Definition

```ts
createInjector = (operation, first, next?) => injector
```

<Legend>
  <Item name="operation">
    <p>
      Required. A string describing this injector. Will typically be the name of
      the injector.
    </p>
  </Item>
  <Item name="first">
    <p>
      Required. A function that will be called the first time the atom that uses
      this injector is evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>Signature:</p>
    <Ts>{`(partialInstance, ...args) => injectorDescriptor`}</Ts>
    <Legend>
      <Item name="partialInstance">
        <p>
          The partial atom instance object of the currently-evaluating atom
          instance. This is an{' '}
          <Link to="../classes/AtomInstance">AtomInstance</Link> class instance
          without the <code>api</code>, <code>exports</code>,{' '}
          <code>promise</code>, or <code>store</code> set yet.
        </p>
      </Item>
      <Item name="...args">
        <p>
          All the rest of the args passed to the injector. For TS users, the
          resulting injector's parameter types will be inferred from the types
          of these args.
        </p>
        <Ts>{`const injectTimes2 = createInjector(
  'injectTimes2',
  (instance, num: number) => ({
    result: num * 2,
    type: 'injectTimes2',
  },
  (prevDescriptor, instance, num: number) => ({
    ...prevDescriptor,
    result: num * 2,
  })
)\n
// in an atom:
injectTimes2(2) // 4`}</Ts>
      </Item>
      <Item name="Returns">
        <p>
          An <Link to="#injectordescriptor">InjectorDescriptor</Link> object.
        </p>
      </Item>
    </Legend>
  </Item>
  <Item name="next">
    <p>
      Optional. If not specified, the InjectorDescriptor returned from{' '}
      <Link to="#first">the first function</Link> will be reused as-is on every
      subsequent evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function that wil be called on every atom evaluation except the first.
    </p>
    <p>Signature:</p>
    <Ts>{`(prevDescriptor, partialInstance, ...args) => injectorDescriptor`}</Ts>
    <p>
      Works exactly like <Link to="#first">the first function</Link>, except it
      receives the last InjectorDescriptor returned (whether by{' '}
      <code>first</code> or <code>next</code>) as the first argument. All other
      args and the return type are the same.
