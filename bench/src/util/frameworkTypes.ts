/** Parameters for a running a performance benchmark test
 *
 * The benchmarks create a rectangular grid of reactive elements, with
 * mutable signals in the first level, computed elements in the middle levels,
 * and read effect elements in the last level.
 *
 * Each test iteration modifies one signal, and then reads specified
 * fraction of the effect elements.
 *
 * Each non-signal node sums values from a specified number of elements
 * in the preceding layer. Some nodes are dynamic, and read vary
 * the number of sources the read for the sum.
 *
 * Tests may optionally provide result values to verify the sum
 * of all read effect elements in all iterations, and the total
 * number of non-signal updated.
