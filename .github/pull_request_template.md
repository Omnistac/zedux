Hello! Thanks for contributing to Zedux. Read this message and delete it to acknowledge receipt.

Make sure you've followed the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Omnistac/zedux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Specifically:

- Make sure the first commit is formatted correctly (via running `yarn commit` in the repo root) and indicates all affected packages.

  We'll use this to generate the changelog and release notes if your PR is merged. Any other commits will be squashed into the first commit. Each PR can only have one commit, so separate changes into separate PRs if needed.

- Make sure the PR title roughly matches the subject line of the first commit. E.g. `feat(react): implement cool new thing`.

Oh and one last thing: We'll likely request some changes. Don't be offended! We're really super excited that you're here.
