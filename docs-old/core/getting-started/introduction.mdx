Zedux is a flexible, multi-paradigm state management tool for JavaScript. It contains utilities for all common aspects of state management.

State is contained in "stores" and updated using various APIs. Stores are lightweight, composable observables of state and actions.

## Philosophies

- **Flexible**

The core philosophy of Zedux. **Zedux apps can have many stores** and should. Each store is flexible, meaning it can adapt to its use case. Need more power? Build a reducer hierarchy. Need some simple, local state? Use zero config stores.

Apps of all sizes should be able to use Zedux comfortably.

- **Composable**

Zedux takes Redux and dips it in React's composable architecture. Stores are composable, which means a store can control some or all of the state of another store. Stores therefore become building blocks of application state. Stateful components that expose a Zedux store can be simultaneously isolated and easily consumed/composed in any application.

- **Opinionated but Configurable**

Simplicity rules. Zedux stores require zero configuration to start. But they're flexible and powerful enough to move with you as your app's state demands increase. Zedux offers high-level apis for speed and simplicity, but also offers low-level escape hatches for everything.

In this page we'll look at how Zedux accomplishes each of these

## Zedux Is Flexible

Storing and updating state in Zedux can be done in many ways. Some approaches are geared toward speed and simplicity, while others make for a more scalable and debuggable code architecture.

There are 2 Core Patterns - the Zero Config Pattern and the Reducer Pattern - with varying levels of abstraction around each.

The approach you pick depends on the situation. The crowning glory of Zedux is that all approaches can be mixed and matched at will. A Zedux app can use different approaches for different stores, adapting to each need individually.

:::important
Each store should only use one core pattern - either the Zero Config or Reducer pattern. A store can contain other stores that use different patterns, but it shouldn't use both patterns itself.
:::

To demonstrate this, all 4 of the following snippets are equivalent. They create a store, initialize the value to `0`, update it to `1`, then back to `0`.

- [Zero Config pattern](FIXME):

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const counterStore = createStore().hydrate(0)

counterStore.setState(1)
counterStore.setState(state => state - 1)
```

- Zero Config with [Inducer pattern](FIXME):

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const increment = state => state + 1
const decrement = amount => state => state - amount

const counterStore = createStore().hydrate(0)

counterStore.setState(increment)
counterStore.setState(decrement(1))
```

- [Reducer pattern](FIXME) - high-level:

```ts
import { createActor, createReducer, createStore } from 'zedux'

const increment = createActor('increment')
const decrement = createActor('decrement')

const rootReducer = createReducer(0)
  .reduce(increment, state => state + 1)
  .reduce(decrement, state => state - 1)

const counterStore = createStore(rootReducer)

counterStore.dispatch(increment())
counterstore.dispatch(decrement())
```

- Reducer pattern - low-level (Redux-style):

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT'
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT'

const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT })
const decrement = () => ({ type: DECREMENT })

const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const counterStore = createStore(rootReducer)

counterStore.dispatch(increment())
counterStore.dispatch(decrement())
```

## Zedux Is Composable

Zedux selectors, inducers, reducers, and even actions are composable. But typically when we say Zedux is composable, we're talking about the stores themselves. No joke! This is an extremely unique and powerful feature that sets Zedux apart from other state management tools.

What does store composition look like? Well quite simply:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

const childStore = createStore()
const parentStore = createStore(childStore)
```

That's it! The `parentStore`'s state is now controlled by `childStore`.

```ts
childStore.setState('some value')
parentStore.getState() // 'some value'

parentStore.setState('a new value')
childStore.getState() // 'a new value'
```

When we set the child store's state, that change propagated to the parent store. When we set the parent store's state, the parent store recognized that the relevant state was controlled by a child store and [delegated](FIXME) that action to the child store. The child store then updated its state and propagated that change back up to the parent.

Now what can you do with that? We won't get into too much here, but here's something a little more meaty:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'

// A simple inducer factory
const addTodo = todo => todos => [...todos, todo]

// Create some stores for this example
const rootStore = createStore()
const todosStore = createStore().hydrate([])
const toNotDosStore = createStore().hydrate([])

// The composition magic!
rootStore.use({
  todos: todosStore,
  toNotDos: toNotDosStore
})

toNotDos.setState(addTodo('be layzee'))
toNotDos.getState() // ['be layzee']
rootStore.getState()
/*
  {
    todos: [],
    toNotDos: ['be layzee']
  }
*/
```

Imagine the possibilities! Higher-Order Stores, code splitting, feature-based code architectures, fractal stores that attach to a root store on mount to maintain time-traversable state and replayable actions.

Treating the store as the basic building block of application state simplifies state management and increases modularity. The Zedux store is an autonomous unit that can simultaneously handle a sub-module's internal workings and present a standardized api to consumers.

If an app uses Zedux stores to handle the internal state of all its modals, forms, widgets, routing, etc, it becomes trivial to integrate those modules into the main app - e.g. to dispatch actions to all or several of them or to implement undo/redo or logging for the entire application.

Zedux stores can also be used to persist state across realms. [Zedux Sync](https://github.com/bowheart/zedux-sync) is an experimental step in that direction.

## Zedux is Opinionated but Configurable

Zedux offers high-level APIs for action creation, action creator creation, selector creation, reducer creation, state machine creation, reducer splitting, store creation, and store composition. These make it easy to get started with Zedux and easy to maintain Zedux apps 'cause standards do that.

All Zedux APIs except `createStore` itself are optional. They can be swapped out for any other abstraction in the Redux ecosystem or can be done manually if you need more low-level, granular control.

For example, the standard way to combine reducers in Zedux is using Zedux's internal hierarchy descriptors:

```ts
import { createStore } from 'zedux'
import { fooReducer, barReducer } from 'somewhere'

const store = createStore({
  foo: fooReducer,
  bar: barReducer
})
```

But you could instead pass a single, root reducer to `createStore` and control this hierarchy yourself:

```ts
const rootReducer = (state = someInitialState, action) => {
  const newFoo = fooReducer(state.foo, action)
  const newBar = barReducer(state.bar, action)

  if (newFoo !== state.foo || newBar !== state.bar) {
    return { foo: newFoo, bar: newBar }
  }

  return state
}

createStore(rootReducer)
```

And of course, `combineReducers` from Redux or any similar tool will also work just fine.
